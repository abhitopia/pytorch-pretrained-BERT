Hello ,

Is someone able to double check that this was added to our account ? It doesn &apos;t look to me like we got the credit . We had skipped a few weeks with the holiday and I haven &apos;t seen any weeks with a discount other than the referral discount . Maybe i am missing it though ...

Thanks ! Hello David ,

Thank you for writing in !

I am sincerely sorry to hear your in store credit was not applied ! I have placed a refund in the amount of , $ 20 ( the amount that was supposed be to credited ) to the card on file . Please allow 3-5 business days for bank processing .

I notice you ’ re a new customer with Freshly and I would love to take this time to tell you a little more about our service .

We are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week !

Just a friendly reminder , your weekly deadline to make changes is every , Sunday , by 5PM PT . The time has changed as daylight savings has ended .

My sincerest apologies for any troubles , David !

If you have additional questions please let me know . I am happy to help !

Customer Service LeadHello support .

My name is Sharine Dinwiddie . I would like to have a trial discounted order sent out to 3 different people . Is this something you can handle ?





2 would be sent to same SF address , 1 would be sent to Concord . But , all billing would be to me .

Thank you

Sharine






Grateful for everyday . 💌 Hello Sharine ,

Thank you for reaching out to us and for your interest in Freshly !

You can order a subscription / subscriptions for someone else using your information and set the gift recipient ’ s address as the shipping address on the subscriptions . This would ensure that you are charged for the subscriptions , but that the gift recipient are the ones who gets the meals . You are able to have multiple subscriptions under one account .

To set up a menu for the first delivery , you &apos;ll want to get the recipients list of desired meals ( or select meals for them , ) then place the order ! We don &apos;t have trial options , so if you want to gift one week only you &apos;ll just need to cancel the subscriptions after their first orders have been shipped . If you &apos;re ordering more than one week , you could share the login details with the recipients so they can make changes to their future orders ! The deadline to cancel or edit meals prior to the second order being charged will also be listed in your Welcome Email !

We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help you manage a subscription if you decide you &apos;d like to give us a try :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?
How do I add a new subscription to my account ?



I hope this helps , Sharine , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !



Fresh wishes ,

Hello Jj ,


Thank you for reaching out to us .


No worries , I have postponed your first delivery for you by cancelling the order that was scheduled to arrive on Wednesday , June 28th . I have as well issued an in-store credit in the amount of $ 59.99 to automatically apply towards your next payment dated . I am afraid that we wouldn &apos;t be able to delivery meals the week of Wednesday , July 5th due to the holiday .


I do see that your subscription has been cancelled at this time , you will need to reactivate to be able to take advantage of this credit . Below is a link that will walk you through reactivating .



How To Reactivate A Cancelled Subscription









Just as a friendly FYI , or reminder if you already knew ! We are a subscription service , this means that you will be charged for and receive meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline . Based on your chosen delivery day of Wednesday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Thursday before 5 : 00 pm PST .



Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :


What is the Meal Planner and how do I use it ?

How can I change the meals I &apos;ll receive on a future order ?



How do I skip a delivery so I don &apos;t receive meals that week ?

Thank you so much for your quick response !

So , if you decide to go with our promotion under our 6 meal plan , you will be paying $ 39 / week ( for 2 weeks ) instead of the regular price of $ 59.99 / week . You would be paying approximately $ 6.50 / meal for those 2 weeks .

Below , I will provide more insight into our other meal plans and pricing ,

( 06 : 07 : 20 AM ) John : All of our entrees can be used as lunch or dinner .

( 06 : 08 : 57 AM ) John : Yes , generally speaking .

( 05 : 47 : 06 PM ) Marco : Hello Marc !

( 05 : 47 : 40 PM ) Marco : I ’ m so sorry for any inconvenience , but I ’ d be more than happy to look to this for you , I can definitely see about apply the promotion if you would like . Otherwise , I would also be happy to cancel .

( 05 : 50 : 26 PM ) Marc Schwartzberg : i did not get the $ 40 off first order as the add stated several times . I just conformed the order. if I don &apos;t get the $ 40 off cancel the order

( 05 : 50 : 35 PM ) Marco : Okay , give me one moment .

( 05 : 50 : 47 PM ) Marc Schwartzberg : sure

( 05 : 50 : 52 PM ) Marco : Thank you !

( 05 : 53 : 20 PM ) Marco : Okay , Marc , what I can do here is apply a refund in the amount of $ 20.00 dollars for that first order .

( 05 : 54 : 17 PM ) Marco : From there I can apply the rest of the promotion as in-store credit in the amount of $ 20.00 for your next order ! This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically apply toward your next charged order .

( 05 : 56 : 14 PM ) Marco : Are you still with me , Marc ?

( 05 : 59 : 07 PM ) Marc Schwartzberg : ok go ahead

( 05 : 59 : 12 PM ) Marco : Okay , give me one moment !

( 05 : 59 : 33 PM ) Marco : Just a friendly reminder , we are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week ! Based on your selected delivery day of Friday , your weekly deadline is Sunday by 2 PM PST !

( 06 : 00 : 21 PM ) Marc Schwartzberg : this sunday ?

( 06 : 00 : 33 PM ) Marco : Let me grab that .

( 06 : 02 : 04 PM ) Marc Schwartzberg : if I don &apos;t complete an order by sunday you ship whatever ?

( 06 : 02 : 35 PM ) Marco : The order from the previous week will re-apply if there are no changes for the meals .

( 06 : 02 : 58 PM ) Marc Schwartzberg : doesnt the menu change weekly

( 06 : 03 : 06 PM ) Marco : It would all start on January 13th on so fourth !

( 06 : 03 : 23 PM ) Marco : Yes , we try to add a new meal and replace a less popular meal on a weekly basis .

( 06 : 03 : 58 PM ) Marco : My apologies for the confusion there , Marc .

( 06 : 04 : 10 PM ) Marc Schwartzberg : thanks send an email of the final result please

( 06 : 04 : 13 PM ) Marco : I am seeing that the promotion was applied onto the first week &apos;s order .

( 06 : 04 : 52 PM ) Marco : The first week was at $ 39.00 , as opposed to the $ 59.99 . The promotion will remove a total of $ 40.00 for the first two weeks .

( 06 : 06 : 44 PM ) Marc Schwartzberg : no the add said 40 off first order never said it was for 2 weeks. perhaps we should just cancel. the add had a reduced price listed and i assumed you had a special with 40 additional discount just to get new customers

( 06 : 07 : 06 PM ) Marco : I sincerely apologize about any confusion there .

( 06 : 07 : 11 PM ) Marco : Let me take a look on my end .

( 06 : 07 : 33 PM ) Marc Schwartzberg : it also said promotion applied at check out

( 06 : 07 : 44 PM ) Marco : Yes , I am taking a look at the promotion on my end .

( 06 : 08 : 12 PM ) Marc Schwartzberg : very deceptive .

( 06 : 08 : 29 PM ) Marco : It would be the li6392x code , correct ?

( 06 : 10 : 58 PM ) Marc Schwartzberg : hold on let me pull it up

( 06 : 11 : 07 PM ) Marco : Okay , no problem .

( 06 : 14 : 00 PM ) Marco : I sincerely apologize Marc , I am afraid that I do see that the promotion was for $ 40.00 through the span of two weeks , I am not seeing a promotion for $ 40.00 dollars off for the 6 meal plan.Hi I need help ASAPHello Sarah !

Thank you for your quick response !

I do apologize for the confusion . Due to the holidays , we were unable to schedule your regular Friday deliveries . This is why you did not receive the second week of meals , as those meals are scheduled to arrive on Friday , January 11th . However , I would be more than happy to take care of canceling your subscription for you .

As requested , I have gone ahead and canceled your subscription for you so there will no longer be any further charges or deliveries from us . You should be receiving a confirmation email advising you that I have taken this action here shortly . If you do decide you &apos;d like to rejoin the Freshly family , we &apos;ve made it super easy to reactivate your subscription , by adding a &quot; Reactivate &quot; button that you can access from your subscription anytime after canceling ! I &apos;ve included a link below to show you just how it &apos;s done :

How To Reactivate A Cancelled Subscription

Thank you so much for spending time with us Leslie , and if you should need anything , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

Customer Service LeadHow did you communicate to your clients that delivery would be unavailable during Christmas and New Years ? I looked through my emails and I have nothing . I count on these meals for health reasons and really would ’ ve appreciated a heads up on this . I certainly wouldn ’ t have skipped my delivery on 12 / 19 if I would ’ ve known it would be an entire month before my next delivery .

Signed ,

Loyal but severely irritated customer

Jennifer WilliamsonHello Jennifer !

Thanks for your email !

I &apos;m terribly sorry for any inconvenience .

You were listed as &quot; not scheduled &quot; for orders the week of December 26th and January 2nd due to the holidays . Our production facility is closed , so affects our production schedule and the availability for your location . You were not charged for any meals those weeks , since you were not scheduled .

We did not send out an email , as it was listed as &quot; not scheduled &quot; in your Meal Planner three weeks prior . I will pass along your feedback regarding notice to our Quality Assurance Team for further review . However , you will resume your regular Wednesday deliveries with your next order on January 9th !

I have placed an in-store credit of $ 20.00 on your subscription for you as a result . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically apply toward your next charged order .

Once again , my sincerest apologies , Jennifer . If you should need anything further , please let me know !

Customer Care SpecialistI scheduled a meal deliver on Jan 21 and then accidentally clicked to delay a week . Is there any way to put my delivery back on the 21st ( or sooner if there is anything available ) . Thank youHi Stephanie ,

Thanks for reaching out ! My apologies for any confusion ! I checked into this , and can confirm you did not skip your first week &apos;s order , and the order is still set for Monday , January 21st . It looks like because this week is already so far in advanced , no future weeks could be skipped since they have not yet been generated . However , once your first delivery gets closer , you &apos;d have the ability to see up to three weeks in advanced , and skip and edit the weeks as needed .

Just as a friendly FYI , ( or reminder if you already knew ! ) we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Mondays , your weekly deadline to make changes is Wednesdays before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?



These are just a few of the really helpful links in our FAQ . You can always access even more information from our FAQ page by clicking on the &quot; Help &quot; tab in the upper right hand corner while logged into your account ! And of course , we are always happy to assist via email , text or phone at 844-FRESHLY or via chat ! Our current hours of operation are from 6am-11pm PT every day .

I hope this helps , Stephanie , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

( 02 : 20 : 50 PM ) Taylor : We &apos;re a weekly based subscription service by nature so once your subscription begins , you can expect deliveries weekly after your first order .

( 02 : 21 : 39 PM ) Carolyn Doyle : Gotcha . Is there a delivery fee ?

( 02 : 22 : 32 PM ) Taylor : You &apos;re only charged the flat rate for the meal plan you choose at sign up , which can range between $ 49.99- $ 107.99 per week . Here &apos;s a link to check out each plan : https : / / www.freshly.com / plans

( 02 : 26 : 12 PM ) * * * Taylor left the chat * * * My sister , age 78 , is a diabetic . Do you have meals suited to her condition ? Hi Marilyn !

Thank you for reaching out to us !

We don &apos;t have meals that are specifically made for diabetics , but we do focus on low-glycemic carbs and never use refined sugars . Because of that , we do have quite a few diabetic customers that order from us . We recommend chatting with your doctor before trying our meals to be sure you ’ re getting the right nutrition for your dietary needs .

You can sort our menu based on specific nutritional values from lowest to highest , including carbs and sugar . The sort feature can be found on the top right corner of the menu when selecting meals during sign-up , or when editing meals in your Meal Planner .

While we don ’ t currently offer gift cards , you can definitely send a weekly subscription as a gift .
Under your personal account , you can add a subscription that uses your billing info for payment and your gift recipient ’ s address for shipping . That way , you ’ re charged but your lucky friend gets the meals .

If you ’ re going out of town or don ’ t need delivery for an upcoming week , you can change the delivery address for that week and send your meals over to someone instead of skipping the week .

If you ’ re signing up your friend for a subscription , and you only want to gift one week , you &apos;ll just need to cancel the subscription after the first order has been shipped . The deadline to cancel or skip weeks will be outlined in your Meal Planner and your Welcome email .

I hope this is helpful , Marilyn ! If I can assist you further , please let me know !

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! I wanted to touch base about the charges for your service . I did not get my order a few weeks ago and I was told I would be refunded 87.99 and get the next order for free . Once charged again after the free order I still had a $ 20 credit and am supposed to be charged 87.99.Hi Garrett ,

Thank you for contacting Freshly ! I &apos;m so sorry for this inconvenience . I see that there was an additional $ 40 in-store credit that should have been applied to your December 29th charged order . Not to worry , I &apos;ve gone ahead and issued you a $ 40 refund back to your credit card on file . Please allow 3-5 business days for the refund to be processed .

I hope this helps , Garrett . Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns .

115 E. 23rd St. , 7th Floor , New York , NY 10010Hello Lee ,

Thank you for reaching out to us today ! I do apologize for any confusion , upon review I do see the subscription was created with our 1 week promotion . We currently have several promotions that would either input the discounted rate for 1 or 2 weeks .

To clarify , our promotion does not provide any free meals but rather it places a credit to give you a discounted rate as a new subscriber . In this case if the 2 week promotion was used it would have added a $ 20.00 credit for the first 2 orders totaling $ 40.00 . You did also state that you &apos;ve been sent the same meals on occasion , this can be because no edits have been made to the order prior to your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Saturday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Monday before 2 : 00 pm PT . Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


These are just a few of the really helpful links in our FAQ . You can always access even more information from our FAQ page by clicking on the &quot; Help &quot; tab in the upper right hand corner while logged into your account ! And of course , we are always happy to assist via email , text or phone at 844-FRESHLY or via chat ! Our current hours of operation are from 6am-11pm PT every day .

I hope this helps , Lee , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !



Fresh wishes ,
Juan C.

Customer Care Specialistf I understand then I am to be given a $ 40 credit never received ? Please advise.Hello Lee ,

Thank you for reaching out to us here at Freshly !

I &apos;m afraid that Juan is currently out of the office , however , I would be more than happy to assist !

I do apologize for any confusion . Your first order you had signed up with a promotional offer . This offer discounted your first order at $ 39.00 . After that first week , you were charged the regular price of our 6 meal plan , which is $ 59.99 .

As far as your meals , you received the same meals each week as there were no changes made to your weekly orders .

I hope this makes things clearer , Lee . Please let me know if you have any other questions !

( 02 : 43 : 39 PM ) Bethany Williams : Hello ! - I just signed up for my first order - if I don ’ t need a weekly order right away after my first one when should I pause my account ?

( 02 : 43 : 44 PM ) * * * Adam joined the chat * * *

( 02 : 43 : 48 PM ) Adam : Hi Bethany !

( 02 : 43 : 59 PM ) Bethany Williams : Hello ☺ ️

( 02 : 44 : 09 PM ) Adam : I can assist you with that !

( 02 : 44 : 23 PM ) Adam : We are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged ) meals on a weekly basis .

In your subscription , you are able to plan out your menus for up to three weeks in advance .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

( 02 : 44 : 37 PM ) Adam : Do you want me to skip the second week for you ?

( 02 : 45 : 03 PM ) Adam : You &apos;ll be able to do so as well , as we get closer to that first order .

( 02 : 45 : 36 PM ) Bethany Williams : Well I was thinking I will know better if I need to skip a week closer to the end of the week I receive my meals

( 02 : 45 : 50 PM ) Adam : Based on your delivery day of Monday , any changes or if you want to skip the week can be made prior to 2pm PT on Wednesdays

( 02 : 45 : 52 PM ) Bethany Williams : I do some traveling and don ’ t want to automatically get it every week

( 02 : 46 : 07 PM ) Bethany Williams : OK then that ’ s what I ’ ll set my reminder to

( 02 : 46 : 35 PM ) Bethany Williams : I ’ ll probably do every other week to start

( 02 : 46 : 38 PM ) Adam : I understand ! If you are an iPhone user , our App is super helpful in managing your subscriptions . It will even remind you before your deadline .

( 02 : 46 : 53 PM ) Bethany Williams : Oh that ’ s great I ’ m on the app right now on my iPhone

( 02 : 47 : 01 PM ) Adam : Perfect !

( 02 : 47 : 15 PM ) Bethany Williams : another question I ’ m not sure if you ’ re familiar with the meals but are they microwavable ?

( 02 : 47 : 24 PM ) Bethany Williams : If I travel to air B &amp; amp ; Bs there ’ s always a microwave but not always an oven

( 02 : 47 : 51 PM ) Adam : I get them delivered to my home as well ! All of the meals can be heated in the microwave !

( 02 : 48 : 09 PM ) Adam : Our meals are designed to be refrigerated to preserve their freshness , they are typically good for 4-5 days upon receiving your meals . All the meals have a use by date on the back , found on the nutrition label .

We understand that life happens and you are not always able to eat them right away . Therefore , if freezing is necessary , you can indeed freeze the meals as well !

( 02 : 48 : 46 PM ) Bethany Williams : oh this is so perfect I think it ’ s just what will work for my lifestyle ☺ ️ ☺ ️ ☺ ️

( 02 : 49 : 05 PM ) Adam : Awesome ! They are super convenient !

( 02 : 49 : 15 PM ) Adam : Is there anything else I can assist you with , Bethany ?

( 02 : 50 : 07 PM ) Bethany Williams : Just one last question in your opinion does it make a big difference between this type of meal and say frozen ones ? ? ? - i ’ m just looking to cut out all of that preservative stuff and hopefully it ’ s more like a home cooked meal also ?

( 02 : 51 : 19 PM ) Adam : Definitely ! We never use any preservatives in our meals . We also have a banned ingredient list of over 85 items that you may find in those &quot; other &quot; meals !

( 02 : 51 : 58 PM ) Bethany Williams : Well it ’ s a good way to start off the new year ! - and thanks Adam - and you have a happy new year also - thanks for the info ! 😊

( 02 : 52 : 03 PM ) Adam : Our overall goal is to provide nutrient-rich dining options that help you eat healthily , feel good , and manage your weight . Chances are , if you are looking for a healthy meal alternative , our service will be a great option for you . All of our meals are gluten-free , peanut-free , packed with natural nutrients , and free of refined sugars .

( 02 : 52 : 13 PM ) Adam : Happy I could help !

( 02 : 52 : 28 PM ) Bethany Williams : ☺ ️ 🎉 ☺ ️ 🎉 ! ! !

( 02 : 52 : 31 PM ) Adam : Please let me know if I can assist you with anything further ! I &apos;d also appreciate your taking our quick survey about your experience once the chat is over .

( 02 : 52 : 42 PM ) Bethany Williams : will do ☺ ️

Penne BologneseHi Kevin ,

Thank you for reaching , and I am so sorry to hear your first order has not arrived as expected !

I &apos;m afraid I was not able to pull up your subscription with this email address to provide exact information on this order . Would you be able to verify the email address or phone number associated with your subscription ?

However , I do want to let you know that , at this time , the carriers with whom we work have lifted their standard delivery times due to the high volume of packages they &apos;re encountering from the holiday season . This means that packages can now be delivered between 8am and 12am at the very latest . If your package does not arrive to you tonight , please reach out at your earliest convenience and we can have this further reported and have you accommodated as well !

Please let me know if you have any other questions , Kevin , or if I can be of further assistance . I am happy to help !



Fresh wishes ,
Madison D.

Wellness SpecialistHey Kevin ,

Thank you for providing that info !

I ’ m so very sorry to hear that you didn &apos;t receive your package as scheduled ! I can certainly understand your frustration . I &apos;m a Freshly customer as well , and I &apos;m very dependent on getting those weekly meals ! While incidents such as these are out of the norm , they can sometimes happen . I have reported this issue to our Delivery Specialist for further investigation into the cause of this delay .

To further express my apologies , I have issued a full refund in the amount of $ 39.00 to cover the cost of the meals you didn &apos;t receive , and you should see those funds post to your account within 3-5 business days . I &apos;ve also applied a 100 % in-house credit in the amount of $ 59.99 for the inconvenience . That credit will automatically apply to your next charge .

Please be aware that those meals are considered spoiled at this point and will need to be disposed of . I certainly don &apos;t want you to risk getting sick by eating any ! I have contacted the carrier to destroy the package .

If you would like an order to arrive for 12 / 20 , that delivery week would have to be unskipped today , prior to 2 pm PST . If I can assist with any of the functions , please let me know . Or , if you would like to wait until after the holidays , your in-house credit will be available for one time use , within 6 months .

Once again , my sincere apologies Kevin , and if you should need anything going forward , I &apos;m always happy to help !




Fresh wishes ,

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Meals were packed oddly this time- ice on top and bottom but none between meals . All meals were on their side in box . Photos attached . Ice was pretty melted but delivery was a full day late . Ice melted and on top- photo one , meals on their sides photo 2 , Ice on top of padding as it appeared bottom of box below meals . It seems you have consistency / quality issues with packing and delivery . Now we see no one to deliver week of Jan. 1 . We had hoped for more kid-friendly meals ( you discontinued breakfast- one of 3 choices our son will eat ) The other choices are worn out . Thanks for always crediting when mistakes are made , but you must be taking huge losses . We want you to stay around and we never would have continued but you have been so good to us . Sincerely wishing you all happy holidays ! Hello Jeanie !

Thanks for reaching out to Freshly !

I &apos;m terribly sorry for this inconvenience . I appreciate you sending in those photos , and I &apos;ll certainly forward this information over to our Quality Assurance Team for further investigation . The ice packs should be packaged inside the box , and layered in between the meals , but hopefully we can rectify this going forward . I &apos;ll also pass your feedback along about wanting more kid friendly meals on our menu . We removed the breakfast dishes to make more room for entrees , but we &apos;ll try to add them back in the future !

We design our meals to withstand 2 days of transit time , and up to 12 hours on your doorstep . As long as the meals were retrieved yesterday and are cool to the touch , they will still be safe to consume !

One of our associates as issued a $ 10.00 in-store credit on your subscription for you . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically apply toward your next charged order .

Once again , my sincerest apologies for this , Jeanie . If you should need anything further , please let me know !



Fresh wishes ,
Victoria R.

Customer Care SpecialistHello Jeanie !

I &apos;m sorry for any confusion before .

I meant to mention this to you in my previous message , but I wanted to let you know that due to the holidays coming up we are not able to deliver meals on your regular Wednesday delivery date . However , you do have the option to receive meals on December 31st instead ! When you click on that week in your Meal Planner , you can select that alternate day . If you &apos;d like , I can select that day for you !

We have limited availability during the holiday season , since our production facility will be closed and it affects the production schedule for that week . Although , you can always check in your Meal Planner to see if we have alternate days available for your area !

I hope this helps , Jeanie . If you have any additional questions , please let me know !

Thank you so much for reaching back out to us with that info .

I am so very sorry for any confusion , however , the first order with us was planned to arrive on Friday , January 4th . This is the soonest that are able to send you meals .

I do not see that the Facebook promo code was used on this order , and since you have already been charged it will be unable to be applied . I apologize deeply for the inconvenience . With that being said , I can add the discount to your subscription for you to be applied to the following two deliveries on January 11th and January 18th .

Just as a friendly reminder , we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Friday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Sunday before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


These are just a few of the really helpful links in our FAQ .

Customer Care SpecialistHello I had a comment . My deliveries are freshly generally come with ontrac . They usually come late in the evening closer to 9 . This evening it was well after 9 : 45 and it still was not on my doorstep . Called on track and they said that it is correct that deliveries at apartments or homes can go as late as 9 p.m . I stay home every Thursday to make sure I get my package right away into my refrigerator . Tonight it got here at 11 : 20 p.m . Pacific Standard Time . See screenshot . Why don &apos;t you give feedback on shipping delivery data in the event you keep these things tract and helps to decide what shipping company to use in the future . For me this delivery was exceptionally late . I had to get to work early in the morning and generally go to bed after I get my deliveries . I do not want anything in the way of a refund just wanted to give feedback . Thank you very much . - Cynthia SantiagoHello Cynthia ,

I ’ m so very sorry to hear that you didn &apos;t receive your package before 9pm ! I can certainly understand your frustration . I &apos;m a Freshly customer as well , and I &apos;m very dependent on getting those weekly meals when I expect them ! Please know that your feedback has been sent to our Quality Assurance team for review .

While incidents such as these are out of the norm , they can sometimes happen . During this time of year , our carriers have advised us that some deliveries may not be delivered until after 9pm , due to the busy holiday season .

To thank you for your feedback and to apologize for this inconvenience , I have applied an in-house credit in the amount of $ 10 . That credit will automatically apply to your next charge .

Once again , my sincere apologies Cynthia , and if you should need anything going forward , I &apos;m always happy to help !

Dear Ginopascucci ,

We &apos;ve been advised by our delivery partner that your order didn ’ t arrive yesterday as scheduled . This is definitely not the type of experience we want for our customers .

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! I want to cancel my subscription . As soon as possible . I am 100 % on this derision . I tried to ask your &quot; chat bot &quot; 3 different times how to cancel and it referred me to articles about cancellation but not how to actually cancel . I find this to be ridiculous that you make cancellation this difficult for the customers you claim to prioritize , especially since a lot of elderly or infirm people tend to be a large customer base of home meal delivery services . Of all people , things should be easy for them if we can help . How do I CANCEL my subscription as soon as possible.Hi Krista ,

Thank you for reaching out to us !

I am so sorry that you had challenges with our Chat Bot , I will certainly pass along your feedback to our Development team ! I have gone ahead and canceled your subscriptions with Freshly ! I did see that you had two under your name , so I went ahead and canceled both ; if this is incorrect please let us know .

While we are sad to see you go , we make it easy for you to reactivate your subscription at any time ! To reactivate , simply log back in and click &quot; reactivate &quot; or by contacting us . I have also attached the link below :

My meals did not deliver on Thursday ( yesterday ) either . I ’ m assuming that this means that if they show up today they will not be fresh , correct . They will be past the 2 day and 12 hour allotted time . Please advise what we will do to replace these meals .

To further express my apologies , I have issued a full refund in the amount of $ 39 to cover the cost of the meals you didn &apos;t receive , and you should see those funds post to your account within 3-5 business days . I &apos;ve also applied a 100 % in-house credit in the amount of $ 59.99 for the inconvenience .

I have reported this issue to our Delivery Specialist for further investigation into the cause of this delay .

I will be sure to have our carrier destroy this package , however , if the meals do arrive I would advise disposing of them immediately as they are no longer safe to consume--they have been in transit longer than our box is guaranteed to keep them fresh .

thank you in advance for checking .

UnsubscribeHello Jeremy !

We are so excited to hear that ! Welcome to the Freshly family !

Just as a friendly FYI , ( or reminder if you already knew ! ) we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Friday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Sunday before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?

How do I skip a week ?


These are just a few of the really helpful links in our FAQ .

We &apos;re so sorry your delivery was delayed .
A note about your delivery

Hello Aja ,

We &apos;ve been advised by our delivery partner that your order didn ’ t arrive yesterday as scheduled . This is definitely not the type of experience we want for our customers .

Because of this delay , your meals will have been unrefrigerated for an amount of time that makes them unsafe to eat . As a result , we have asked the carrier to discard your package , although there &apos;s a chance it will still arrive . If this happens , please dispose of the meals without eating them . Your health is our top priority and we can no longer guarantee the freshness of your order , even if the meals still feel cold .

Please accept our sincere apologies — it &apos;s extremely frustrating to expect to get your meals and then have to make a new plan . Due to this , we &apos;ve given you a 100 % refund for your order ( this should appear in your bank account within five business days ) . Additionally , we &apos;ve added a 50 % off in-store credit to your subscription ; this will be valid for six months from now and will automatically apply the next time you &apos;re charged for an order .

Again , we &apos;re so sorry about this and truly appreciate your patience !

Sincerely ,
The Freshly Team

115 E. 23rd St. , 7th Floor , New York , NY 10010Hi Aja ,

Thanks so much for your follow up !

I &apos;m so sorry for any confusion regarding the previous message received , as those messages are automated . I &apos;m terribly sorry for the inconvenience regarding the delay of our December 6th order . Please know that we take delivery issues extremely seriously . It &apos;s certainly never our intention to not have your meals arrive as scheduled , and as we continue to grow we &apos;re working to put better measures in place to avoid situations like this , and provide better communication when delays do occur !

I &apos;ve taken a look and can confirm the reason you didn &apos;t see a refund post to your bank account is because you were not charged for this order via the card on file . This order was covered by a 100 % in house credit in the amount of $ 59.99 . I &apos;ve attached a screenshot of the charge for this order to also show the credit to have covered the order .

For the inconvenience , I &apos;ve gone ahead and issued a full in house credit to your subscription in that amount , $ 59.99 . This credit will remain valid on your subscription for up to 6 months from today and will automatically apply to the total of your next charged order - please enjoy those meals on us !

Just a friendly reminder , your weekly deadline to make any changes to your future orders is each Friday before 5 pm EST .

Again , my sincerest apologies for the confusion , Aja ! If there &apos;s anything I can do to assist you further , please let me know !



Fresh wishes ,

Customer Service Lead

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! I was billed on 12 / 8 for my order received on 12 / 12 . Now I see a charge on 12 / 14 but my future orders skipped ... further I was expecting a credit which was promised by Freshly due to a delayed order on prior shipment .

Sent from my iPhoneHello Cathleen !

Thank you so much for reaching out to us , and I &apos;m so sorry for any confusion in regards to your upcoming order ! I &apos;m absolutely happy to take care of this for you , as we certainly don &apos;t mean to catch anyone by surprise !

I &apos;ve gone ahead and cancelled the order , and I &apos;ve issued a 100 % in-house credit to your subscription in the amount of $ 49.99 to cover the cost of the meals that were charged . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically apply toward your next charged order .

As a friendly reminder , your regular weekly deadline is Thursday by 2pm PT if you need to make any changes to any upcoming orders . In regards to the credit you had mentioned , I &apos;d be more than happy to look into this for you ! Which delayed order are you referring to ? I see one of our associates issued a $ 10.00 in-store credit on your subscription for a delay on November 27th . That credit automatically applied to your December 12th order , so you were only charged $ 49.99 instead of $ 59.99 .

I hope this helps , Cathleen , and if you should need anything further , please reach out , as I &apos;m always happy to help !

Customer Service LeadWhy no delivery on 12 / 27 and 1 / 3 ? Hi Steve ,

Thanks for reaching out to us today ! I do sincerely apologize for any trouble !

I checked into this , and it looks like these weeks are closed off due to the holidays . In order for us to reach you on Thursdays , your meals would need to be shipped out on Tuesday for both weeks , which would be Christmas and New Years . Since our carriers would not be open these days , we would not be able to ship , have anything in transit , or have anything delivered on that day . Additionally , we could not ship anything out for delivery on Friday or Saturday either , as this would require the meals to sit in refrigeration for an extra day , which would compromise their freshness . I do sincerely apologize !

I do hope this helps , Steve ! My apologies again for the trouble , and please let me know if you should need anything else !

Thank you so much for reaching out to us , and I &apos;m so sorry for any confusion in regards to your upcoming order ! I &apos;m absolutely happy to take care of this for you , as we certainly don &apos;t mean to catch anyone by surprise !

I want you to know that I will do everything I can to stop these meals from being produced and shipped . Rest assured , those meals will not go to waste ! Whenever possible , we do our very best to donate all leftover meals to those in need .

With that said , if I ’ m unable to prevent these meals from shipping , you may receive a shipping notification via email ... so please consider that order on us ! If those meals do end up shipping , perhaps you might be able to gift them to a friend or family member ! Regardless , I &apos;ve issued an in-house credit to your subscription in the amount of $ 59.99 to cover the cost of the meals for which you were charged . This credit will remain active for up to 6 months and automatically apply to your next scheduled order .

As a friendly reminder , your regular weekly deadline is Wednesdays by 2pm PT if you need to make any changes to your subscription or individual order ( s ) .

I hope this helps , Rummana , and if you should need anything further , please reach out , as I &apos;m always happy to help !

Customer Care SpecialistWhy does it say it can ’ t deliver two weeks in a row ? Hello Stephanie ,

Thank you for reaching out to us today .

I am so very sorry , however , due to Christmas and New Years , delivery days are extremely limited due to the closures that both Freshly and the carrier have . We are unable to prepare and ship meals in time for them to arrive fresh and safe to eat , so the weeks have been closed . After the holidays , deliveries should return back to normal .

I hope this helps explain , Stephanie . If there is anything else I can do to assist , please do not hesitate to let me know .

Since it won &apos;t let me make the changes can it be done for me.Hello Judith ,

Thank you for reaching out to us today !

I am so very sorry that you were not able to make changes to your January 11th order . This is because once you are charged for an order , the choices are locked in on your end . However , I was able to make these changes for you , so the following meals are due to arrive on that date :


BBQ Shredded Beef ( 2 )
Balsamic-Glazed Turkey ( 2 )
Korean-Style Shrimp ( 2 )


Just as a friendly reminder , we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Friday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Sunday before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :

( 02 : 02 : 59 PM ) Steffanie : I don &apos;t want Paypal to take from my paypal balance EVER ... I want credit card payment ONLY . How can we set this up ? Money in my paypal account is dedicated to my LLC and I am now short $ 60 , I set Freshly to take from my credit card and wasn &apos;t made aware at that time that Freshly would &quot; Take from paypal balance first always , then use card as backup &quot; .

( 02 : 03 : 13 PM ) Josh : Hi Steffanie !

( 02 : 03 : 18 PM ) Josh : Thanks for reaching out to Freshly !

( 02 : 03 : 20 PM ) Steffanie : Hi

( 02 : 03 : 59 PM ) Josh : I would be happy to look into this for you .

( 02 : 04 : 05 PM ) Steffanie : Thank you

( 02 : 04 : 10 PM ) Josh : Could you please verify the phone number associated with the subscription ?

( 02 : 04 : 17 PM ) Steffanie : 920-540-9238

( 02 : 04 : 25 PM ) Josh : Thank you , Steffanie .

( 02 : 05 : 11 PM ) Steffanie : I am excited you are finally able to deliver to our area , a few of us have been waiting over a year for this ! Hopefully we can fix this payment option

( 02 : 05 : 34 PM ) Josh : So , because your subscription was set up using our PayPal Feature , it will automatically pull from your PayPal account .

( 02 : 06 : 02 PM ) Josh : We can always cancel the subscription , issue a refund and then set up a new subscription strictly using a credit card instead of going through PayPal .

( 02 : 06 : 41 PM ) Steffanie : Ok , will that mean losing my meals I chose already ? And losing the $ 40 credits that my friends are going to sign up using my link with ?

( 02 : 07 : 21 PM ) Josh : Not at all , you can still use the code from your friends signing up .

( 02 : 07 : 27 PM ) Josh : And we can still choose the same meals for yo u !

( 02 : 08 : 03 PM ) Steffanie : There &apos;s no way to sign in , and just change payment options ?

( 02 : 09 : 11 PM ) Josh : Because you had initially signed up using PayPal , we don &apos;t have a way to go through and change that unless it &apos;s on a new subscription .

( 02 : 09 : 15 PM ) Josh : I am so sorry , Steffanie .

( 02 : 09 : 54 PM ) Steffanie : Ok , I will do a new subscription then ... when my friends sign up , how do I know ? To get this code you speak of for the $ 40 credit ?

( 02 : 10 : 06 PM ) Josh : It will still go to your email .

( 02 : 10 : 10 PM ) Steffanie : since it will be through my old subscription ?

( 02 : 10 : 14 PM ) Steffanie : Oh ok

( 02 : 10 : 19 PM ) Josh : You can still use the same account , you would just need to set up a new subscription .

( 02 : 10 : 25 PM ) Josh : Here is how to add another subscription to your account :

( 02 : 10 : 41 PM ) Josh : Did you want me to cancel this one and issue a refund ?

( 02 : 11 : 00 PM ) Steffanie : Yes please , thank you for your help !

( 02 : 11 : 28 PM ) Josh : Of course !

( 02 : 12 : 10 PM ) Josh : I went ahead and cancelled your order and subscription and have issued a refund in the amount of $ 59.99 .

( 02 : 12 : 15 PM ) Josh : Please allow 3-5 business days for this to post .

( 02 : 12 : 18 PM ) Steffanie : It wont let me sign in to add a new subscription - so I just create a new account now ?

( 02 : 13 : 36 PM ) Steffanie : Can I still get Wednesday January 9th delivery ? It now says Friday Jan 11th is the only next option

( 02 : 13 : 51 PM ) Steffanie : And same meals ?

( 02 : 13 : 54 PM ) Josh : You can certainly create a new account if you would like .

( 02 : 14 : 18 PM ) Josh : The same meals we can certainly do . And the 9th should show as available , let me check .

( 02 : 14 : 23 PM ) Steffanie : It wont let me log in to my old account , so I assumed I have to create new

( 02 : 15 : 22 PM ) Josh : Okay , since we just cancelled that order , the same available day should be available for you to select .

( 02 : 15 : 38 PM ) Steffanie is now known as Steffanie Christensen .

( 02 : 15 : 49 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : Oh hey it just let me sign in !

( 02 : 15 : 55 PM ) Josh : But It does look like it is now just saying Friday the 11th as the first day available .

( 02 : 15 : 58 PM ) Josh : That &apos;s good !

( 02 : 16 : 07 PM ) Josh : You should see an add subscription button .

( 02 : 18 : 32 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : I don &apos;t want Friday deliveries , that &apos;s too late for my family ...

( 02 : 19 : 59 PM ) Josh : Monday through Friday delivery is still available as a default delivery day in your area , but it seems that until it updates with the availability from the order we just cancelled , the 11th is the soonest we can deliver out there , but setting another day as your default will make it so once those days become available , you will receive deliveries on those days , every week .

( 02 : 20 : 40 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : Ok that helps to know thank you

( 02 : 20 : 58 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : do I have to re-activate my account , then add a new subscription ? I dont see the button anywhere to &quot; add subscription &quot;

( 02 : 21 : 03 PM ) Josh : My pleasure , I am so sorry for any of the confusion regarding this .

( 02 : 21 : 42 PM ) Josh : Do you see the Freshly Logo at the top of the screen in the middle ?

( 02 : 22 : 15 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : Yes

( 02 : 22 : 17 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : I clicked it

( 02 : 22 : 51 PM ) Josh : If you click that it should have a box in the middle that says &quot; View Meal Planner &quot;

( 02 : 22 : 58 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : Yes

( 02 : 22 : 58 PM ) Josh : And &quot; Add new subscription : . /

( 02 : 23 : 02 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : Nope

( 02 : 23 : 02 PM ) Josh : Right below it .

( 02 : 23 : 19 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : Nothing below it - I know it should be there , the video shows it but it &apos;s not

( 02 : 24 : 05 PM ) Josh : You may have to reactivate to see it and then add and then I can cancel again for you .

( 02 : 24 : 20 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : I think I need to try a different browser

( 02 : 24 : 31 PM ) Josh : Okay , let me know if that works .

( 02 : 25 : 35 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : Nope ... tried in Firefox and IE and it &apos;s still not there : (

( 02 : 25 : 51 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : let me try reactivating like you said

( 02 : 26 : 04 PM ) Josh : You may have to reactivate , add the subscription and then I can go in and deactivate .

( 02 : 28 : 03 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : Reactivated ... refreshed browser , still not there

( 02 : 28 : 22 PM ) Josh : What if you try creating a new account .

( 02 : 28 : 26 PM ) Josh : See if that would work ?

( 02 : 28 : 57 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : Looks like I will have to

( 02 : 29 : 23 PM ) Josh : That is so strange . It may have to do with the PayPal option . Let me check with my team .

( 02 : 30 : 07 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : Now I go to cancel subscription and it tells me Error 404

( 02 : 30 : 22 PM ) Josh : I already cancelled it for you : )

( 02 : 32 : 42 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : Ok thanks

( 02 : 33 : 01 PM ) Josh : MY pleasure !

( 02 : 33 : 07 PM ) Josh : Let me know if adding a new account worked .

( 02 : 34 : 38 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : It wont let me add a new account , because my e-mail is already associated with the old account

( 02 : 35 : 25 PM ) Josh : Do you have an alternate email you could use ? You can still use the friend referral codes from the original subscription on the new one if you would like .

( 02 : 35 : 53 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : No , this is my main email . Only other email I have is work and I can &apos;t have personal emails going there

( 02 : 36 : 18 PM ) Josh : Okay .

( 02 : 36 : 20 PM ) Josh : Try your email now .

( 02 : 37 : 04 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : That worked !

( 02 : 37 : 13 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : Ok , signing up via cc payment this time

( 02 : 37 : 18 PM ) Josh : Perfect .

( 02 : 37 : 24 PM ) Josh : Let me know when the sign up is completed .

( 02 : 37 : 36 PM ) Josh : Just to make sure everything is set up properly .

( 02 : 38 : 20 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : Though I want to say , it really sucks you require Paypal to take from a paypal account first . Paypal is much safer than direct CC payments and there will be more people like me who want to go through paypal , but NOT using the money sitting in their paypal account

( 02 : 38 : 39 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : I hope you guys can look into this and make Paypal an option , using the CC in paypal FIRST

( 02 : 38 : 48 PM ) Josh : So , anything PayPal charge related would be on PayPals side .

( 02 : 38 : 58 PM ) Josh : They may have a way to set it up to where it pulls from your card first .

( 02 : 39 : 12 PM ) Josh : But it would be how your PayPal account is set up .

( 02 : 39 : 56 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : No it &apos;s something on your end

( 02 : 40 : 14 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : I always use Paypal for everything , and I have auto payments set up to pull from my CC

( 02 : 40 : 34 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : when I log in , it &apos;s Freshly saying THEY will ALWAYS pull from paypal account first , then use CC as backup

( 02 : 40 : 37 PM ) Josh : Well I would be happy to see if there is anything our team can do in the future .

( 02 : 40 : 44 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : That would be great : )

( 02 : 40 : 55 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : Thank you for all your help today

( 02 : 41 : 01 PM ) Josh : No worries .

( 02 : 41 : 02 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : account looks like it &apos;s all set up right

( 02 : 41 : 03 PM ) Josh : Is there anything else I can assist you with ?

( 02 : 41 : 08 PM ) Josh : Perfect !

( 02 : 41 : 26 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : FYI - NOW the &quot; add new subscription &quot; button is there !

( 02 : 41 : 36 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : weird

( 02 : 41 : 47 PM ) Steffanie Christensen : ok thank you , have a great day !

( 02 : 42 : 00 PM ) Josh : Thank you for contacting Freshly ! I &apos;d appreciate your taking our quick survey about your experience once the chat is over !

( 02 : 42 : 01 PM ) * * * Josh left the chat * * * Hello I wanted to cancel my subscription for personal reasons but it looks like my delivery for this week is out already . I am unable to receive them within the day , could you please notify the carrier to return or dispose of the package so it doesn &apos;t spoil ?

Thank you ! Hey William ,

While we &apos;re certainly sorry to see you go , I can confirm that your subscription has been cancelled . You will not receive any further charges or deliveries .

Your last paid order is scheduled to arrive tomorrow . That order has now been refunded in full . You will get a separate email as confirmation , please allow 3 - 5 days for that to post . I have alerted the shipping team that you have cancelled , and I &apos;ve attempted to stop the delivery . Since this order billed back on Monday , there is a change that it will still ship . If that happens , maybe there is a friend or neighbor that can enjoy those meals .

I &apos;m sorry our subscription service didn &apos;t work for you at this time . I invite you , to check back with us , as we continue to introduce new exciting meals and plans ! You can also reactivate with one click when you ’ re ready !

How do I reactivate my subscription ?

If you ever have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

( 02 : 20 : 52 PM ) Ashley Levesque : After the 19th I see i won ’ t get another delivery till the new year , which is fine because of the holiday ! But I ’ m curious what date will I get my next delivery after December 19th .

( 02 : 21 : 10 PM ) Kasandra : Hi Ashley !

( 02 : 21 : 17 PM ) Kasandra : Thanks for reaching out today !

( 02 : 21 : 29 PM ) Kasandra : Give me just a sec to take a look at your subscription .

( 02 : 23 : 57 PM ) Kasandra : So I see here that your delivery day is currently set for Wednesdays , so December 26th you won &apos;t receive an order due to the holiday and January 2nd you won &apos;t receive a delivery , unless you change your delivery day for that week .

( 02 : 24 : 15 PM ) Kasandra : So as it stands , your next delivery will be January 9th .

( 02 : 24 : 55 PM ) Ashley Levesque : Make sense ! What day can I change it to where it would deliver ?

( 02 : 25 : 47 PM ) Kasandra : As the weekly meal planner updates ( since we only show about 3 weeks in advance on the website because that &apos;s how far in advance we plan ) , you will see the week of January 2nd and in the meal planner you may have an option for Saturday delivery .

( 02 : 26 : 03 PM ) Kasandra : I

( 02 : 26 : 17 PM ) Kasandra : I &apos;d say give it about another week and you should begin to see that week .

( 02 : 26 : 29 PM ) Ashley Levesque : Awesome ! For the 26th one it won ’ t let me edit it at all . Is that whole week blocked ?

( 02 : 27 : 15 PM ) Kasandra : Just as a friendly reminder , with a Wednesday delivery day , your weekly deadline for making changes to your order for that week will be Friday before 2 PM PT .

( 02 : 27 : 55 PM ) Kasandra : Yes , our facility where the meals are prepped will be closed to give employees time off to be with their families the week of Christmas , so there will be only a few deliveries .

( 02 : 29 : 17 PM ) Kasandra : You still with me , Ashley ?

( 02 : 29 : 19 PM ) Ashley Levesque : That ’ s wonderful ! I just wanted to check ! So I won ’ t get meals the week of Christmas , but need to change my delivery day for the following week !

( 02 : 30 : 06 PM ) Kasandra : Exactly ! Now , it isn &apos;t for sure that the weekly meal planner will give you an option to change to Saturday , simply due to demand and the limited availability we have for that week , but it may .

( 02 : 31 : 16 PM ) Ashley Levesque : Awesome ! I just like to plan ahead budget wise ! Thank you so much for all your help ! Freshly is amazing and really have enjoyed the meals and customer service ! Thank you !

( 02 : 31 : 38 PM ) Kasandra : Aww . Thank you ! We &apos;re so happy you &apos;re a part of the Freshly family !

( 02 : 04 : 03 PM ) Samantha : Hello Catherine !

( 02 : 04 : 06 PM ) Samantha : We don &apos;t have meals that are specifically made for diabetics , but we have quite a few customers that order from us who are diabetic . This is mainly because we do not use any refined sugars , and focus on low-glycemic carb meals ( or simply low-carb meals ) . We always recommend that anyone with a pre-existing medical condition speak to their doctor before enjoying our meals to be sure you would be getting the proper nutrition for your dietary needs .

( 02 : 04 : 50 PM ) Catherine Benjamin : OK .Thanks for the info .

If you would like to reactivate , you can do so at any time by logging in to your meal planner and accessing your subscription settings .

( 02 : 26 : 26 PM ) Russell : Oh , gotcha !

( 02 : 26 : 45 PM ) Barbara Durning-McHenry : I was told this was done . It is important they get the the 6 meal plan on Jan 9 .

( 02 : 26 : 51 PM ) Russell : So the 4-meal subscription ( My Subscription ) should be cancelled , correct ? This the one with the cancelled 1 / 9 order .

( 02 : 27 : 02 PM ) Barbara Durning-McHenry : Yes

( 02 : 27 : 15 PM ) Barbara Durning-McHenry : Only 6 meal plan . One subscription only .

( 02 : 27 : 19 PM ) Russell : Thanks for confirming ! Yes , the 4-meal order for Jan. 9th is set .

( 02 : 27 : 31 PM ) Russell : Correction : 6-meal plan for Jan. 9th is set .

( 02 : 27 : 34 PM ) Barbara Durning-McHenry : It is a 6 meal plan for Jan 9

( 02 : 27 : 37 PM ) Barbara Durning-McHenry : Lol

( 02 : 27 : 49 PM ) Russell : Haha ! Sorry !

( 02 : 27 : 51 PM ) Barbara Durning-McHenry : Can that be reflected accurately in app ?

( 02 : 28 : 05 PM ) Russell : Let me cancel the wrong subscription first .

( 02 : 28 : 08 PM ) Barbara Durning-McHenry : And then the next week should show 6 meals ... etc

( 02 : 28 : 13 PM ) Barbara Durning-McHenry : Thank you ! ! ! !

( 02 : 28 : 28 PM ) Barbara Durning-McHenry : It is odd as I do get email of cancellation ...

( 02 : 28 : 39 PM ) Russell : Could the email be about the refund ?

( 02 : 28 : 41 PM ) Barbara Durning-McHenry : Please ensure I will be refunded

( 02 : 29 : 21 PM ) Barbara Durning-McHenry : It is

( 02 : 29 : 40 PM ) Russell : Ah , great ! This should be referencing the 1st ( and only ) Jan. 9th cancellation .

( 02 : 30 : 12 PM ) Russell : Would it help if I changed the name of the remaining active subscription to My Active Subscription ?

( 02 : 30 : 20 PM ) Barbara Durning-McHenry : Yes please

( 02 : 31 : 15 PM ) Barbara Durning-McHenry : Whatever works - so that I only have one subscription and it shows correctly in app w food ordered to be delivered . And refund for first subscription

( 02 : 31 : 22 PM ) Russell : I see what happened . My Subscription was initially cancelled on Dec. 10th by my colleague , Stephen .

( 02 : 31 : 39 PM ) Barbara Durning-McHenry : Great , thanks

( 02 : 31 : 57 PM ) Russell : Then , somehow , it was reactivated on your end on Dec. 10th , too , later that day .

( 02 : 36 : 05 PM ) Russell : Basically , when you open the app , go to Account ( lower right corner ) , then Manage Subscription .

( 02 : 36 : 23 PM ) Russell : Then pick My Active Subscription .

( 02 : 36 : 25 PM ) Barbara Durning-McHenry : What should I do there ? Don ’ t want to reactive again ! Lol

( 03 : 02 : 30 PM ) john : ok , thanks josh . So , I need to submit what i want in advance , correct ?

( 03 : 03 : 08 PM ) Josh : That is correct , it needs to be submitted by your weekly deadline , and you can set it up as early as 3 weeks before .

( 03 : 03 : 46 PM ) john : i tried what you said. still dont see a menue : (

( 03 : 04 : 02 PM ) Josh : Did you click a week from the left hand side ?

( 03 : 04 : 13 PM ) john : yes

( 03 : 04 : 19 PM ) Josh : Click the one that says &quot; January 18th &quot;

( 03 : 04 : 26 PM ) john : i did

( 03 : 04 : 30 PM ) Josh : And then you will see a green button that says &quot; Change meals &quot;

( 03 : 04 : 34 PM ) john : i see my previous order

( 03 : 04 : 51 PM ) Josh : If you click on that button , you will be able to see every meal offered for that week .

( 03 : 04 : 55 PM ) john : ohhh. but it wont effect my original order , will it ?

( 03 : 05 : 01 PM ) Josh : Correct .

( 03 : 06 : 00 PM ) john : ok , i just chose two new meals .... now what ?

( 03 : 06 : 23 PM ) Josh : You would click save at the bottom right .

( 03 : 06 : 25 PM ) john : hit save ?

( 03 : 06 : 29 PM ) john : lol

( 03 : 06 : 47 PM ) Josh : But be sure that you are only selecting 6 meals total as you are currently set up for 6 meals per week .

( 03 : 06 : 56 PM ) Josh : Anything over 6 total meals and it won &apos;t let you save .

( 03 : 07 : 00 PM ) john : ok ... done. so those meals now represent 2 weeks worth of food ?

( 03 : 07 : 28 PM ) john : no , i only chose the 4 meal plan for now

( 03 : 07 : 30 PM ) Josh : Sorry .

( 03 : 07 : 34 PM ) Josh : I just saw that .

( 03 : 07 : 50 PM ) john : i will upgrade if the wifey likes it , lol

( 03 : 07 : 54 PM ) Josh : So I see for both the week of the 11th and the 18th you have Grilled Chicken Risotto and Veggie Baked Penne selected .

( 03 : 08 : 03 PM ) Josh : Did you want those same meals for both weeks ?

( 03 : 08 : 03 PM ) john : no

( 03 : 08 : 33 PM ) john : i chose turkey meatballa and sauage baked penne

( 03 : 08 : 36 PM ) Josh : So if you go into your meal planner and find 2 meals you wanted to try , you would need to make each meal have a quantity of 2 .

( 03 : 08 : 56 PM ) john : i did that

( 03 : 09 : 49 PM ) Josh : Okay , I went in and changed them for you to those 2 meals . Did it show the other set of meals on the list on the right as well after you selected the new ones ?

( 03 : 10 : 44 PM ) john : no. the 18th still shows the same as the 11th. let me try first so i get the hang of it .... stand by

( 03 : 11 : 01 PM ) Josh : If you refresh it should now show differently .

( 03 : 11 : 10 PM ) john is now known as John Miskanic .

( 03 : 11 : 38 PM ) John Miskanic : ahhh yes. it changed. now how many weeks in advance can i order ?

( 03 : 12 : 25 PM ) Josh : You can currently do up to 6 weeks I believe from the current day , which is why it is only showing through the week of the 18th .

( 03 : 12 : 54 PM ) John Miskanic : gotcha . Is the time I order the only time i can see the menue ? ?

( 03 : 13 : 04 PM ) John Miskanic : from the site ?

( 03 : 13 : 14 PM ) Josh : Nope , you can go to freshly.com / on-the-menu

( 03 : 13 : 22 PM ) Josh : This will show you the menu for the current week !

( 03 : 13 : 31 PM ) John Miskanic : id rather not go throuh a link josh . Is there a tab ?

( 03 : 14 : 12 PM ) Josh : Click the freshly icon at the center top of your subscription .

( 03 : 14 : 16 PM ) Josh : Scroll all the way down .

( 03 : 14 : 31 PM ) Josh : Under learn more select ( on the menu ) .

( 03 : 14 : 34 PM ) Josh : Which is the first option .

( 03 : 14 : 53 PM ) John Miskanic : ahhh. got it

( 03 : 15 : 35 PM ) Josh : : )

( 03 : 15 : 37 PM ) Josh : Is there anything else I can assist you with ?

( 03 : 15 : 41 PM ) John Miskanic : yes .

( 03 : 15 : 53 PM ) John Miskanic : my service starts on Janurary 11th .

( 03 : 15 : 59 PM ) Josh : Correct .

( 03 : 16 : 38 PM ) John Miskanic : this means at this point i cant order 6 weeks in advance , or actually six week of meals from my perspective . When will that change ?

( 03 : 17 : 36 PM ) Josh : Correct , since it is 6 weeks from todays date , though , this is just temporary as this was so our new customers who will be utilizing our east coast facility could order before we open up .

( 03 : 17 : 41 PM ) Josh : So it should go back to 3 weeks in advance .

( 03 : 17 : 41 PM ) Josh : But

( 03 : 17 : 48 PM ) Josh : This will change once you are up to date .

( 03 : 18 : 00 PM ) Josh : So on the week of your first order , you will be able to see menus for 3 weeks out .

( 03 : 18 : 11 PM ) Josh : If not , 6 weeks if it still doesn &apos;t change .

( 03 : 18 : 33 PM ) John Miskanic : ok , so in the future , Ill only be able to order up to 3 weeks worth of meals in advance ?

( 03 : 18 : 55 PM ) Josh : Unless they decide to keep it at 6 weeks .

( 03 : 18 : 57 PM ) Josh : Then yes .

( 03 : 19 : 32 PM ) John Miskanic : ok , so its possible that i will be able to order 6 weeks . Good . When would that be avaiable to me ?

( 03 : 19 : 51 PM ) Josh : Assuming this does not change .

( 03 : 19 : 51 PM ) John Miskanic : once it starts ?

( 03 : 20 : 00 PM ) Josh : The week of the 11th you should see the maximum amount of weeks .

( 03 : 20 : 13 PM ) Josh : As you will be current with when your order starts .

( 03 : 20 : 17 PM ) John Miskanic : ok cool. where will these meals be coming from Josh ? ?

( 03 : 20 : 28 PM ) John Miskanic : NJ ?

( 03 : 20 : 35 PM ) Josh : Our facility is in

( 03 : 20 : 41 PM ) Josh : Maryland .

( 03 : 20 : 49 PM ) John Miskanic : ok , east coast

( 03 : 20 : 49 PM ) Josh : I believe in Savage , MD to be exact .

( 03 : 21 : 06 PM ) John Miskanic : and they are kept fresh through out ?

( 03 : 21 : 48 PM ) Josh : Of course . Our meals are delivered Fresh and already cooked . When you receive the meals , we suggest you place the meals in the refrigerator .

( 03 : 22 : 15 PM ) John Miskanic : and if my wife or I arent happy with the food , we can cancel the subscription at an time , right ?

( 03 : 22 : 39 PM ) Josh : That is correct . As long as you do so before your weekly deadline .

( 03 : 22 : 46 PM ) Josh : Otherwise , one more order will be sent .

( 03 : 23 : 01 PM ) John Miskanic : how long will they last in the fridge ? if we freeze them are they still good after we defrost them ?

( 03 : 23 : 29 PM ) Josh : The meals that we send to customers have a use-by date of about 4 days after they are delivered - although the shelf life could vary slightly in some cases . You can check the “ use by ” date on a meal ’ s cardboard sleeve for more specifics regarding that meal itself . We do the best we can to ensure the freshness of our meals by packaging them securely and ensuring they are nice and cool during the shipping process .

( 03 : 24 : 13 PM ) John Miskanic : but can we freeze them if we cant eat by the expiration date ?

( 03 : 24 : 38 PM ) Josh : You may , if needed , freeze meals to make them last longer - in which case , when it comes time to heat the meals , simply microwave for one to two minutes from the frozen state prior to following the printed heating instructions .

( 03 : 25 : 30 PM ) John Miskanic : ok , great. thanks Josh for your time . Have a great weekend

( 03 : 25 : 36 PM ) Josh : You as well , John .

( 03 : 25 : 43 PM ) Josh : Thank you for contacting Freshly ! I &apos;d appreciate your taking our quick survey about your experience once the chat is over !

( 03 : 25 : 46 PM ) * * * Josh left the chat * * * Good Morning ,

My name is Eric Bates and I have been a proud subscriber of your website for the past 6 months or so using your service every 2 of 3 weeks due to my work schedule . I have to work 12-hour shifts that alternate between day shift and night shift . I have barely enough time to do much when I &apos;m not working which I why I started using your company in the first place . However , the my packages have to be delivered to my apartment complex &apos;s leasing office for some reason and typically the office will bring my package over to my apartment since I can &apos;t make it there before they close .

This last package the lease office at my apartment has refused to drop off my package that I received on Tuesday ( 25th ) even after I called and emailed them to do so . It is still in the office today ( 29th ) which is way past what your policy says for the ice packs .

I would love to continue using your service but if you can &apos;t deliver the packages to my apartment door and I have to keep losing packages due to my lease office then I do not want to keep throwing away money for this service .

Is there anyway I could get a discount on my next order and a reason as to why the packages can &apos;t be delivered to my apartment door ?

I look forward to hearing back from you.Chat started : 2018-12-29 03 : 02 PM UTC

( 03 : 04 : 11 PM ) Taylor : Thanks for your patience , Claire ! I &apos;ve now cancelled your subscription for you , so you shouldn &apos;t receive any further charges or deliveries from us unless you log back in and reactivate your subscription .

( 03 : 04 : 29 PM ) Claire Campbell : I ’ m not wanting to cancel , simply hold for 6 weeks !

( 03 : 05 : 00 PM ) Taylor : Our cancel acts as a hold . You can reactivate when you &apos;re ready to order more meals by signing in and clicking the green &quot; Reactivate &quot; button .

( 03 : 05 : 22 PM ) Claire Campbell : ok , thanks !

( 03 : 05 : 28 PM ) Taylor : You &apos;re welcome !

Thanks ,

ChrisHi Christopher ,

Thank you so much for reaching out , and welcome to the Freshly family !

If you would prefer not to use aluminum foil when covering your meals in the oven , the best idea would be to use an oven safe container with an oven safe lid .

Just as a friendly FYI , ( or reminder if you already knew ! ) we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Saturday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Monday before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


These are just a few of the really helpful links in our FAQ . You can always access even more information from our FAQ page by clicking on the &quot; Help &quot; tab in the upper right hand corner while logged into your account ! And of course , we are always happy to assist via email , text or phone at 844-FRESHLY or via chat ! Our current hours of operation are from 6am-11pm PT every day .

I hope this helps , Christopher , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

ChrisGood morning Sonny ,

I just received an ad to join Freshly and was very disappointed to see the deal being offered compared to what I paid ( $ 59.99 ) . The deal is offering 2 weeks for $ 39.99 . Can I please get that same deal ? I would appreciate it .

Thanks ,

Thanks for reaching out to us !

I &apos;m sorry for any confusion .

I &apos;m afraid that creating two separate subscriptions is something that happens on the user end . I &apos;m not sure exactly how you created those subscriptions . I am aware that we have a link titled , &quot; Add New Subscription &quot; once you are signed in near our homepage that you can click on to create a second subscription under your name . I can confirm you only have one active subscription with us titled , &quot; My Subscription , &quot; and an order scheduled for January 21st !

( 04 : 35 : 16 AM ) Taylor L. : Hello Phyllis , thanks for reaching out .

( 04 : 35 : 19 AM ) Taylor L. : One moment while I pull up your subscription to look into this for you ! I went to &quot; meal planner &quot; and it just showed the first week ( which is in January ) of my trial with your company . I was wondering how to view meal options for future deliveries ... and this request is coming from someone who usually doesn &apos;t &quot; plan ahead &quot; ! Thanks for your prompt attention to this request.Hello Kathy ,

Thank you for reaching out to us !

I do apologize about any confusion ! We show you up to three weeks ahead worth of orders , but it &apos;s based off the current week we &apos;re in . Right now , with your order being so far in advance , we can &apos;t show you any future orders . As we move closer to your order , you &apos;ll see more options available !

Since you &apos;re a new customer with us , I just wanted to let you know we are a weekly and automatic subscription service . This means that you will automatically be charged for and then delivered meals on a weekly basis . Of course , there is no contract or commitment . You are able to skip your orders or cancel your service as you need . You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Wednesday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Friday , before 2 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :

How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?


How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?


How do I skip a week ?

You can always access even more information from our FAQ page by clicking on the &quot; Help &quot; tab in the upper right hand corner while logged into your account !

I hope this helps , Kathy , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

Customer Service SpecialistMy final order has yet to ship . How will it get to me before the expiration date ? Hello Jonathan ,

Thanks for reaching out to us ! I &apos;m sorry for your trouble !

I &apos;m afraid your Dec. 13th meals will be spoiled even if they arrive today , Friday , Dec. 14th , so please make sure to dispose of them if they do get delivered . I already put in a destruction request but our shipping carrier cannot guarantee this so just FYI .

Our Delivery Specialist has been notified about this for further investigation and you have been fully refunded for this order . You should see $ 87.99 in your bank records within 3 - 5 business days .

As a further apology , there &apos;s also a $ 20 in-house credit for one-time use within the next 6 months if &amp; amp ; when you decide to reactivate your currently cancelled subscription . Here &apos;s the link on how to do this in case you need it in the future ( or you can let me know ) : How do I reactivate my subscription ?

Let me know if you need further help , Jonathan !

Thanks for contacting Freshly !

I &apos;m so sorry to hear you received the wrong order ! Could you please provide photos or a list of the meals that you received so I can make sure you &apos;re accommodated ?

As soon as I hear from you , Claudia , I &apos;ll be in touch as soon as possible with a resolution . Again , I &apos;m so sorry for the inconvenience this evening and hope to hear from you shortly .

Thank you for reaching out to us , and I apologize for any confusion ! In light of the issue , I have issued a $ 10 in-house credit to your subscription that will automatically apply to your next scheduled order or remain active for up to 6 months . To avoid receiving the same meals in the future , as your initial order acts as your default menu until you make changes , you can change the meals that you receive until your weekly deadline of Fridays before 2pm PT and up to 3 calendar weeks in advance . You can also skip weeks in your meal planner , before this deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Thursdays , your weekly deadline to make changes is Fridays before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Hey Freshly team ,


Well , this is odd . I received 10 meals in my last shipment instead of 12 . I believe this is the 2nd time for this to happen in about 2 years .


I have the pictures here from the immediate unboxing .


I don &apos;t think you can send me 2 meals separately , so not sure how to take of this ? I will have a day of no meals though . : (


Please advise . Thanks.Hi Lamar ,

Thanks so much for reaching out to us today and bringing this to our attention !

I &apos;m so very sorry to hear two of your meals were missing from your box ! It is very unusual for there to be any such problems and I want to ensure you that we will report the incident to our quality assurance team so they can investigate further . We are always seeking to improve our service and pride ourselves on high levels of accuracy , so the fact that you did not receive a proper order is very disappointing to us . Thank you for your patience as we work diligently to improve our service and ensure only the best possible outcome for our customers !

I &apos;m afraid your pictures did not come through correctly in your email , as I am unable to view or click them . However , can you please let me know which two meals were missing , so that I can properly report and accommodate this issue ?

Thanks so much Lamar ! I do hope this helps and my apologies again for the trouble !

If your meals arrive today , they will have been unrefrigerated for an amount of time that makes them unsafe to eat .

115 E. 23rd St. , 7th Floor , New York , NY 10010Hi Sheila ,

Thanks so much for your follow up !

I ’ m so very sorry to hear that you didn &apos;t receive your package as scheduled ! I can certainly understand your frustration . I &apos;m a Freshly customer as well , and I &apos;m very dependent on getting those weekly meals ! While incidents such as these are out of the norm , they can sometimes happen . I have reported this issue to our Delivery Specialist for further investigation into the cause of this delay .

I will be sure to have our carrier destroy this package , however , if the meals do arrive I would advise disposing of them immediately as they are no longer safe to consume--they have been in transit longer than our box is guaranteed to keep them fresh .

To further express my apologies , I have issued a full refund in the amount of $ 39 to cover the cost of the meals you didn &apos;t receive , and you should see those funds post to your account within 3-5 business days . I &apos;ve also applied a 100 % in-house credit in the amount of $ 59.99 for the inconvenience . That credit will remain valid for up to 6 months and will automatically apply to your next charge - so please enjoy those meals on us !

Just as a friendly FYI , ( or reminder if you already knew ! ) we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Wednesday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Friday before 2 : 00 pm PT .

( 03 : 16 : 04 PM ) * * * Russell left the chat * * * Why wont we not get deliveries on December 28thHi Angel ,

Thank you for reaching out to us , and I apologize for any confusion ! Due to the Christmas holiday , and our kitchen closing in observance , we are unable to deliver meals the week of Christmas and New Years . Your deliveries will resume on Friday , January 11th .

Just as a friendly FYI , ( or reminder if you already knew ! ) we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Fridays , your weekly deadline to make changes is Saturdays before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


These are just a few of the really helpful links in our FAQ . You can always access even more information from our FAQ page by clicking on the &quot; Help &quot; tab in the upper right hand corner while logged into your account ! And of course , we are always happy to assist via email , text or phone at 844-FRESHLY or via chat ! Our current hours of operation are from 6am-11pm PT every day .

I hope this helps , Angel , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

( 03 : 03 : 23 PM ) Samantha : Hello Sheila !

( 03 : 03 : 27 PM ) Samantha : I am so very sorry to hear this !

( 03 : 03 : 30 PM ) Samantha : One moment while I pull up your subscription to look into this for you .

( 03 : 04 : 24 PM ) Samantha : I do see that there was a delay with your order this week , and I apologize deeply for this ! I am not sure why this delay occurred , however , I will be letting our delivery specialist know about this so they can contact the carrier to try to find out more information .

( 03 : 04 : 29 PM ) Samantha : Because the meals did not arrive to you on the correct day , when the carrier is able to attempt delivery the meals will no longer be safe to consume . We have reached out to try to have this package stopped , however there is a slight chance it may still arrive . If it does , the meals will need to be disposed of right away .

( 03 : 04 : 48 PM ) Samantha : To further express my apologies , I have issued a full refund in the amount of $ 39 to cover the cost of the meals this week . Refunds may take 3-5 business days to completely process , however this can vary depending on your bank . I &apos;ve also applied a 100 % in-store credit in the amount of $ 59.99 for the inconvenience . This credit will be automatically applied to your next charge with us and will be available for a one time use within the next 6 months .

( 03 : 06 : 37 PM ) Sheila Forrester : Thank you ! You guys have fantastic customer service . Much appreciated .

( 03 : 07 : 00 PM ) Samantha : You &apos;re very welcome , Sheila . Again , I apologize deeply for the inconvenience .

( 03 : 07 : 15 PM ) Samantha : At this time , your next order is planned for January 9th , and those will be shipped to you at no additional cost .

( 03 : 07 : 22 PM ) Samantha : Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time ?

( 03 : 10 : 17 PM ) Samantha : Since I have not heard back from you , I am going to bring this chat to a close . If you need further assistance , you can simply start typing away in your chat window to restart the chat .

( 03 : 09 : 06 PM ) Annie Green Howard : Great thanjs

( 03 : 09 : 28 PM ) Kailey : No problem ! Just a moment !

( 03 : 11 : 41 PM ) Kailey : Okay Annie , so it looks like you are set to Tuesdays going forward after your first delivery on Friday , January 11th . I &apos;m afraid I can not set that order any earlier , as Tuesday is unavailable , but after that you &apos;d be set to Tuesdays , with a normal weekly deadline of Thursdays at 5 PM EST .

( 03 : 12 : 01 PM ) Annie Green Howard : Ugh , so I can &apos;t even move it to Tuesday the following week ?

( 03 : 12 : 14 PM ) Annie Green Howard : This is super frustrating . Fridays don &apos;t work well for me and I didn &apos;t know that when I paid

( 03 : 14 : 35 PM ) Kailey : It looks like Tuesday the 15th is currently over capacity . I do apologize ! I can see about moving the delivery day to the following Tuesday if that works better ? Also I do apologize that you were unaware Friday was selected . The first available day would come up in the sign up process , but customers can change this if needed prior to submitting the order , so I do apologize if this information was missed !

( 03 : 16 : 35 PM ) Annie Green Howard : I didn &apos;t see anything about changing the day but I easily could have missed it . Thanks for your help . Actually that following Tuesday is bad - would the 23rd work ?

( 03 : 17 : 07 PM ) Kailey : Not a problem ! Let me check on that just a second !

( 03 : 17 : 32 PM ) Kailey : Wednesday the 23rd correct ?

( 03 : 17 : 37 PM ) Annie Green Howard : Yes. that would be great .

( 03 : 17 : 50 PM ) Kailey : Got it ! Just a moment !

( 03 : 20 : 16 PM ) Kailey : Okay Annie ! I was able to postpone your first delivery to Wednesday 1 / 23 . After that you &apos;d receive deliveries on Tuesdays .

( 03 : 40 : 14 PM ) Connie Conley : Okay . I will wait . Hopefully , the box will arrive today . If it does not , I will back in touch .

( 03 : 40 : 14 PM ) Brianna R. : I am very sorry about this , Connie . Once the package is in the hands of the carrier , we only have so much control over the delivery . I can assure you that our delivery specialist will be looking into this .

( 03 : 40 : 38 PM ) Connie Conley : Thanks you Brianna .

( 03 : 40 : 47 PM ) Brianna R. : You are very welcome !

Anyway we can change that first delivery date to the 1 / 18 / 19 or 1 / 21 / 19 ?

( 03 : 52 : 34 PM ) Brianna R. : Thank you !

( 03 : 52 : 54 PM ) Brianna R. : The only other date that I can move it to would be January 12th , as we schedule things by week .

( 03 : 53 : 24 PM ) John B Kent : Original delivery is January 11th ?

( 03 : 53 : 33 PM ) Brianna R. : That being said , I could cancel it and then you could reactivate when you are ready to sign up .

( 03 : 53 : 51 PM ) Brianna R. : Yes , your first delivery is January 11th .

( 03 : 53 : 54 PM ) Brianna R. : I notice you ’ re a new customer with Freshly and I would love to take this time to tell you a little more about our service .

We are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week !

( 03 : 54 : 09 PM ) Brianna R. : Your deadline is every Sunday before 2 pm PT , and will only change if you alter your delivery date .

( 03 : 54 : 21 PM ) John B Kent : So you can move it only 1 day ?

( 03 : 54 : 54 PM ) Brianna R. : That is correct .

( 03 : 55 : 21 PM ) John B Kent : So if I redo it now what will be the delivery date for the first delivery ?

( 03 : 55 : 57 PM ) Brianna R. : I am not sure of the day that it would be , most likely the 11th or 12th .

( 03 : 56 : 13 PM ) Brianna R. : I would suggest reactivating next week .

( 03 : 56 : 36 PM ) Brianna R. : That should automatically assign you a later delivery day .

( 03 : 57 : 04 PM ) John B Kent : Will I still get the promotional rate ?

( 03 : 57 : 18 PM ) John B Kent : Because I will no longer be a &apos; new &apos; customer if I cancel .

( 03 : 57 : 23 PM ) Brianna R. : Yes , it should still apply , but if not you can reach out to as and we can adjust it !

( 03 : 59 : 15 PM ) John B Kent : Can I suggest you bring this up to someone who may be able to change the policy or procedure ? You are actively cancelling a guest hoping I will come back because the date cannot change . Not very user friendly . I am not raving about it ... just a suggestion .

( 03 : 59 : 38 PM ) John B Kent : Go ahead and cancel it and if I have time I will redo it next week .

( 04 : 00 : 32 PM ) Brianna R. : I will be sure to pass along your feedback to our quality assurance team !

( 04 : 01 : 01 PM ) Brianna R. : You are all set !

Thanks for reaching out !

I went ahead and postponed your first delivery for you for one week , from the 21st to the 28th , so you are all set , and will receive your first delivery on Monday , January 28th . I hope this helps !

Just as a friendly FYI , ( or reminder if you already knew ! ) we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Mondays , your weekly deadline to make changes is Wednesdays before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?



These are just a few of the really helpful links in our FAQ . You can always access even more information from our FAQ page by clicking on the &quot; Help &quot; tab in the upper right hand corner while logged into your account ! And of course , we are always happy to assist via email , text or phone at 844-FRESHLY or via chat ! Our current hours of operation are from 6am-11pm PT every day .

I hope this helps , Richard , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

( 03 : 55 : 35 PM ) Debbie : OK - I will try that then . Thanks !

( 03 : 55 : 40 PM ) Adam : Once you sign up we will give you a weekly deadline , and that is when any changes would need to be made by .

( 03 : 00 : 15 PM ) Adam : Hi Aulia !

( 03 : 00 : 27 PM ) Adam : How can I assist you ?

( 03 : 00 : 35 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : Unless you really assure to get it delivered to my door and have me present to receive it , I would not risk it

( 03 : 00 : 42 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : Just read my previous chat

( 03 : 01 : 09 PM ) Adam : I do apologize that the previous chat is not available to me at this time .

( 03 : 01 : 34 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : I have placed an order for a scheduled delivery on January 19 , 2019 . My credit card has been charged for this purchase .

But I want to cancel my order because I read the reviews saying that the packaging is bulky , loaded with ice , and would be very heavy . I live on 4th floor at a building with no elevator so I figure it would be just too much hassle to lift the package and get it to my kitchen . I once have a knee and back issue just to lift something heavy so I won ’ t waste my time and money for the risk .

This meal plan is amazing ideas , though ! And I ’ d love to try it shall there ’ s an option of delivery to my door .

( 03 : 02 : 02 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : Your colleague ’ s answer : Thanks for reaching out to Freshly ! The meals are typically delivered to your front door , but if you prefer to proceed with cancelling , I can certainly assist you with that .

( 03 : 02 : 35 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : But , you cannot guarantee the delivery if you use the word “ typically ” , no ?

( 03 : 02 : 47 PM ) Adam : We do deliver to the door , unless your building has a policy otherwise .

( 03 : 02 : 54 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : Unless you really assure to get it delivered to my door and have me present to receive it , I would not risk it

( 03 : 03 : 00 PM ) Adam : You do not need to be present , they will leave it if you are not home .

( 03 : 03 : 35 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : How can they deliver to my door if I am not present to buzz them in ? ? ? ?

( 03 : 03 : 49 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : I want to be present

( 03 : 03 : 55 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : That ’ s what I mean

( 03 : 03 : 59 PM ) Adam : The meals are deliver via carriers such as FedEx

( 03 : 04 : 04 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : See

( 03 : 04 : 17 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : The FedEx cannot go directly to my door

( 03 : 04 : 38 PM ) Adam : I see , is there a door code you would like us to add for you ?

( 03 : 04 : 39 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : The delivery people NEVER want to go upstairs to deliver

( 03 : 04 : 47 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : No there is no door code

( 03 : 04 : 57 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : People have to let them in when they buzz

( 03 : 05 : 12 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : So please proceed with the cancellation

( 03 : 05 : 30 PM ) Adam : Certainly ! One moment please !

( 03 : 05 : 51 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : Unless your service works like Amazon Fresh , I think many people would hesitate to use your service just because of the delivery issue

( 03 : 06 : 59 PM ) Adam : I understand ! Most people just have them delivered to their door without issue .

( 03 : 07 : 23 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : Just cancel this please

( 03 : 07 : 51 PM ) Adam : I &apos;ve now cancelled your subscription for you , so you shouldn &apos;t receive any further charges or deliveries from us .

( 03 : 08 : 03 PM ) Adam : We do hope you will consider joining us again sometime in the future . We are always seeking to improve our service and are constantly adding new , delicious meals .

( 03 : 08 : 14 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : Did you cancel the upcoming one on January 19 ?

( 03 : 08 : 18 PM ) Adam : Please allow 3-5 business days for the refund to post to your account .

( 03 : 08 : 29 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : Ok

( 03 : 08 : 42 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : Thanks

( 03 : 09 : 23 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : You should really take the delivery process into account of the service

( 03 : 09 : 32 PM ) Adam : You &apos;ll get an email confirmation of the refund and cancelation shortly .

( 03 : 09 : 42 PM ) Aulia Nastiti : Yes I got it

( 04 : 08 : 55 PM ) Adam : Happy to help you !

( 04 : 09 : 13 PM ) Lakesha : Thank You

( 04 : 09 : 28 PM ) Adam : Every Freshly meal is carefully crafted by our team of chefs and nutritionists using only real , all-natural ingredients . As a little background , we create our menu around high-quality proteins , healthy fats , and complex carbs that come from nutrient-dense veggies , whole grains , and natural sweeteners . Some of the ingredients that we use naturally contain cholesterol , which is present in animal meat , dairy , and eggs .

( 04 : 09 : 52 PM ) Lakesha : Also

( 04 : 10 : 03 PM ) Lakesha : My first order doesnt come until the 18th of Jan.

( 04 : 10 : 05 PM ) Adam : The cholesterol in our meals is not derived from any additives or processed ingredients . We don ’ t use any fillers or additives that some food companies use to reduce the amount of cholesterol present in their meals . Instead , we ’ re dedicated to using ingredients in their natural form to bring you food that you can feel good about .

In general , our meals average about 80-90 mg of cholesterol , with meals as low as 60 mg of cholesterol .

( 04 : 10 : 58 PM ) Lakesha : And trying to see when will myt next charge and next order come . Trying to see if my husband will have the chance to see what he likes before changing his order for the next week

( 04 : 11 : 26 PM ) Adam : One moment while I pull up your subscription to look into this for you !

( 04 : 12 : 40 PM ) Adam : We are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged ) meals on a weekly basis .

In your subscription , you are able to plan out your menus for up to three weeks in advance .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

( 04 : 13 : 10 PM ) Adam : Based on your chosen delivery day of Friday , any changes to your weekly order , or if you decide to skip the week , would need to be made by Saturday , prior to 2 pm PT .

( 04 : 13 : 25 PM ) Lakesha : Thank You

( 04 : 13 : 36 PM ) Adam : My pleasure !

( 04 : 13 : 42 PM ) Adam : Is there anything else I can assist you with , Ana ?

( 04 : 13 : 54 PM ) Lakesha : Thats it

( 04 : 14 : 08 PM ) Adam : Please let me know if I can assist you with anything further ! I &apos;d also appreciate your taking our quick survey about your experience once the chat is over .

( 04 : 14 : 40 PM ) Adam : Lakesha , I &apos;m sorry , not sure where I got Ana !

( 04 : 14 : 52 PM ) Lakesha : LOL

( 04 : 14 : 53 PM ) Lakesha : DOnt worry

( 04 : 14 : 56 PM ) Lakesha : I laughed at it

( 04 : 14 : 58 PM ) Lakesha : Its fine

( 04 : 15 : 14 PM ) Adam : : ) Thank you ! Happy New Year !

( 04 : 15 : 18 PM ) * * * Adam left the chat * * * I just pulled the tracking info &amp; amp ; it states my order won &apos;t be delivered till next week . My concern is , of course , if the food will still be edible by then . The items are being shipped to my office , where I am most days , but we have had issues with the FedEx driver . I won &apos;t be ordering again if it &apos;s going to be an issue . Will see if I even get my order .

Cory DeLisleHello Cory ,

Thank you so much for reaching out this evening ,

I can most certainly look into this for you ! I have pulled up your tracking information and you are correct the tracking information indicates your meals will be delivered Monday the 31st . By this point , your meals would be in transit longer than 2 days so they would not be safe to consume .

However , there is still a possibility your meals will arrive tomorrow Saturday the 29th . The tracking information shows that your meals are currently in transit from Bloomington California . I would have to allow the carrier to meet the deadline before I can further assist you . Rest assured , I have forwarded the incident to our delivery team to review and contact you if need be .

In the meantime , I have gone ahead and issued you an in-house credit in the amount of $ 20 to automatically apply to your next shipment for the week of Saturday , January 5th . Cory , I hope you can accept my sincerest apologies for the trouble .

Just as a friendly FYI , based on your chosen delivery day of Saturday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Monday before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


These are just a few of the really helpful links in our FAQ . You can always access even more information from our FAQ page by clicking on the &quot; Help &quot; tab in the upper right hand corner while logged into your account ! And of course , we are always happy to assist via email , text or phone at 844-FRESHLY or via chat ! Our current hours of operation are from 6am-11pm PT every day .

I hope this helps , Cory , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! I didn &apos;t actually choose Sat . I just placed an order &amp; amp ; waited to get my info from you folks . I received an email at 3pm today stating my order would arrive tomorrow but the tracking says Mon . Since I hadn &apos;t planned on being in the office tomorrow , I really NEED to know when it will arrive so I can rearrange my entire day to be there tomorrow . This obviously seems like an inconvenient system . If it won &apos;t be received tomorrow , I assume this entire purchase will be refunded , since as you state , it won &apos;t be safe to consume . The credit doesn &apos;t do me any good as I won &apos;t be ordering again if the 1st order can &apos;t manage to arrive . Please advise .

Thank you so much for your quick response ,

First and foremost , I just want to personally apologize for the confusion . At signup , you are given delivery dates to chose from so I do apologize that Saturday was not a good fit . It is never our intention to cause troubles or any inconvenience , and in fact , we are a service that prides ourselves on being one of convenience and efficiency .

I wouldn &apos;t want to inconvenience you , Cory . But , I am afraid to say , I would not be able to guarantee a specific time tomorrow .

I can certainly refund your order in full and have the shipment cancelled . Either way , if you do not receive it tomorrow , we would definitly be issuing you a full refund .

Once more , I apologize for the trouble . Please let me know what you would like me to do , I want to make sure I can make things right .

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Yeah this obviously isn &apos;t going to be a good fit at all . I definitely don &apos;t have the time to try to make this work . I run 2 companies &amp; amp ; can &apos;t rearrange my schedule to be available to deal with FedEx . Honestly if I &apos;d known FedEx was the delivery service , I wouldn &apos;t have placed the order . Cancel everything &amp; amp ; please refund . Such a waste . The whole point of this was to not waste food . Very disappointed .

Thanks for your help .

I am so very sorry I wasn &apos;t able to do more , I truly am sorry .

I can most certainly get this situated for you . Cory , I can confirm that your subscription is cancelled , and you will no longer receive any further charges or deliveries from us moving forward . I have issued you a full refund in the amount of $ 39 back to your card ending in 9110 . You can expect those funds within 3-5 business days depending on your financial institution .

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Thanks Ronny .

I appreciate it . I had a hard time even placing the order because it kept backing out &amp; amp ; starting over . I &apos;m fairly tech savvy but it definitely requires some patience , which I &apos;m lacking . I &apos;m ridiculously busy so hoped this would &apos;ve worked . Thanks for your help .


Happy New Year .

( 04 : 15 : 25 PM ) Taylor : We only forecast up to 3 weeks in advance from the current date so depending on when your first order is scheduled so you &apos;ll just need to wait a week or so for more weeks to populate for edits .

( 04 : 15 : 54 PM ) Bob : Ok , that &apos;s what the problem is . My first order is January 21st

( 04 : 16 : 30 PM ) Taylor : Yes , since your first order is already scheduled within 3 weeks from now , that &apos;s the only date you &apos;ll see in your meal planner at the moment . As we get closer to that date , more future weeks will begin to populate .

( 04 : 26 : 16 PM ) Deena Evans : Does my delivery date always have to be on a Friday ?

( 04 : 26 : 20 PM ) * * * Taylor joined the chat * * *

( 04 : 26 : 23 PM ) Taylor : Hi Deena !

( 04 : 26 : 56 PM ) Taylor : Thanks for reaching out to Freshly ! I &apos;ll be glad to take a look to see if there are any alternate options for delivery for you .

( 04 : 27 : 02 PM ) Taylor : Just a moment , please .

( 04 : 28 : 59 PM ) Taylor : Thanks for your patience , Deena ! We have some options for an alternate delivery , but not immediately . The Friday , January 11th order is the only day available for delivery that week , all other days have been sold out . The week of January 18th , the only alternate option would be Saturday , January 19th .

( 04 : 29 : 20 PM ) Taylor : Moving past those two orders , it looks like we have the option to choose a delivery day of Tuesday - Saturday .

( 04 : 31 : 23 PM ) Deena Evans : So is it a first come first serve type situation ? Do you have to make sure you put your order in enough in advance to get the delivery day that you want ? I &apos;m new to ordering from Freshly . Typically , I order from Home Chef and the delivery options seem to be more flexible .

( 04 : 32 : 32 PM ) Taylor : Yes , with newer subscriptions , you &apos;re jumping into a subscription based service with existing customers who are also vying for delivery dates you may be interested in . Once you &apos;ve secured a delivery day , you can expect a delivery on that day each week .

( 04 : 33 : 26 PM ) Taylor : Would you like to skip the next two Friday deliveries and choose a new date or would you like to remain on Friday for those two orders ?

( 04 : 34 : 52 PM ) Deena Evans : Right now I &apos;ll stick to the Friday , January 11th date . I would like to try the meals first to see if I like them . If I continue then I would prefer a Tuesday delivery date .

( 04 : 35 : 30 PM ) Taylor : Great ! I &apos;ll go ahead and select Tuesday as your default delivery day following those orders .

( 04 : 35 : 45 PM ) Deena Evans : That would be great !

( 04 : 35 : 54 PM ) Taylor : You got it , Deena !

( 04 : 36 : 13 PM ) Taylor : For the next two Friday orders , your weekly deadline to make any changes is each Saturday before 2 pm PT .

( 04 : 36 : 14 PM ) Taylor : Please let me know if I can assist you with anything further ! I &apos;d also appreciate your taking our quick survey about your experience once the chat is over .

( 04 : 36 : 34 PM ) Deena Evans : Okay , thanks .

( 04 : 38 : 57 PM ) Benjamin Woodford : Why was my delivery skipped this week ?

( 04 : 39 : 00 PM ) * * * Taylor joined the chat * * *

( 04 : 39 : 05 PM ) Taylor : Hi Benjamin !

( 04 : 39 : 58 PM ) Taylor : Thanks for reaching out to Freshly ! You likely weren &apos;t scheduled for a delivery this past week since our kitchen will have restricted hours over the holidays , this past Christmas and the upcoming New Years Day , so that our staff can spend time with their families . Same goes for the 3rd party carriers , thus limiting the amount of orders that can be shipped . Any major holiday weeks will default to the &quot; unable to deliver &quot; status &amp; amp ; you &apos;ll see this forecasted in your meal planner up to 3 weeks in advance .

( 04 : 40 : 07 PM ) Taylor : Could you please verify the phone number associated with the subscription so I can take a look to be sure this was the case ?

( 04 : 40 : 31 PM ) Benjamin Woodford : 7078438433

( 04 : 40 : 36 PM ) Taylor : Thanks ! Just a moment , please .

( 04 : 42 : 19 PM ) Taylor : Thanks so much for your patience , Benjamin ! I can confirm the reasoning above the be why there was no delivery scheduled for December 28th . Your next delivery is scheduled to arrive on January 4th . For any inconvenience experienced , I &apos;m happy to issue a $ 20 in house credit . This credit will remain valid on your subscription for up to 6 months from today and will automatically apply to the total of your next charged order .

( 04 : 43 : 03 PM ) Taylor : Just as a friendly reminder , we are a weekly subscription service by nature . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . Based on your default delivery day of Friday , your deadline to make changes to an upcoming order or to skip a week is each Sunday before 2 pm PT . Is there anything else I can assist with today , Benjamin ?

( 04 : 43 : 31 PM ) Benjamin Woodford : Thank you . It &apos;s good to know . I still got a shipping notification . Maybe you should let someone know to check the notification settings .

( 04 : 43 : 52 PM ) Benjamin Woodford : That &apos;s all . Thanks !

( 02 : 35 : 23 AM ) Alondra : Thank you !

( 02 : 37 : 13 AM ) Alondra : I see that your first delivery date is Monday , January 21st and we do forecast up to 3 weeks in advance and a new week will populate into your meal planner after each week . So once a week is over , a new week will populate into your meal planner and you will be able to make any changes needed by your weekly deadline . We will send you your weekly email reminder to make any changes needed or skip a week for an upcoming order by your weekly deadline .

( 02 : 38 : 34 AM ) Liz Hofstetter : So I can only see the first week , 1 / 21 and then once that week is over a new menu will show ?

( 02 : 38 : 45 AM ) Alondra : That is correct !

( 02 : 39 : 08 AM ) Alondra : We forecast 3 weeks from today &apos;s date , not from 3 weeks from your delivery date .

( 02 : 39 : 40 AM ) Liz Hofstetter : Ah , I see . So the 1 / 28 menu is not yet available .

( 04 : 41 : 15 PM ) Crystal : Hello , I &apos;m trying to kind of figure out Freshly and how it works . I chose a plan and then it wants me to choose a delivery day but the first one is Monday Jan 21st . Does Freshly only deliver once a month ?

( 04 : 41 : 23 PM ) * * * Adam joined the chat * * *

( 04 : 41 : 30 PM ) Adam : Hi Crystal !

( 04 : 41 : 35 PM ) Crystal : hi

( 04 : 41 : 44 PM ) Adam : We are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged ) meals on a weekly basis .

In your subscription , you are able to plan out your menus for up to three weeks in advance .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

( 04 : 42 : 04 PM ) Adam : Due to our second kitchen opening in a couple weeks , this is why you see a delay initially .

( 04 : 42 : 50 PM ) Crystal : ohhhhh ok so they do deliver every week but this is just a weird time I guess ?

( 04 : 43 : 21 PM ) Adam : Due to the high demand , all of our earlier delivers have been filled . I am so sorry !

( 04 : 43 : 28 PM ) Crystal : no worries

( 04 : 43 : 55 PM ) Crystal : I am currently subscribed to another food place but I have to cook the meals so I thought I would look into this one instead .

( 04 : 44 : 12 PM ) Crystal : the menu changes weekly for Freshly ?

( 04 : 44 : 13 PM ) Adam : Certainly ! We do all the cooking for you !

( 04 : 44 : 38 PM ) Adam : We want to ensure the best variety in tastiness for our customers , so we add one new meal ( sometimes two ! ) to our menu almost every week . This would either involve adding in a completely new meal or revamping a pre-existing meal to make it even more delicious .

( 04 : 44 : 56 PM ) Crystal : ok awesome thanks !

( 04 : 45 : 08 PM ) Adam : Is there anything else I can assist you with , Crystal ?

( 04 : 45 : 40 PM ) Crystal : nope that was all , was just wondering why the next delivery was almost a month away lol

( 04 : 46 : 07 PM ) Adam : No worries ! Happy I could help ! I hope we can cook for you soon !

There &apos;s no place in app to do that specifically , you &apos;ll enter those instructions on the &quot; Company &quot; line when entering your address so you &apos;d have to update that to do so .

What am I missing ?


I selected 6 dinner meals , but it wouldn &apos;t let me save it . Isn &apos;t that the correct minimum weekly order ?


I also wanted to order 6 berry porridge , but spent 20 minutes trying to figure out where to find the breakfast options on the website . Never succeeded .


I gave up . Please let me know how to purchase the above .


Thank you ,
Bonnie

115 E. 23rd St. , 7th Floor , New York , NY 10010Hello Michelle !

Thanks for your message !

I deeply apologize for any confusion .

I see your subscription was cancelled on December 26th at 6 : 54pm after we had charged you for your December 29th order on December 24th at 3 : 22pm . Once an order is charged , we would have to be notified directly about cancelling the order from shipping out . Cancelling the subscription does not cancel an order once it &apos;s been charged . We send out email notifications once we have charged you for an order as well . Sometimes our emails filter through a &quot; promotion &quot; folder or a &quot; spam &quot; folder , so I &apos;m sorry if that message missed you !

Because these meals have already been cooked and are in the hands of the carrier , I ’ m afraid I wouldn ’ t be able to cancel the order . We do have a brief window after your weekly deadline where we can usually stop an order from going out , but I ’ m afraid that we &apos;re beyond that period of time . We do not accept any return shipments , as the items inside are perishable .

I truly wish there was more I could do ! However , I can confirm your December 29th order will be your last order from us , unless you decide to reactivate your subscription .

My sincerest apologies , Michelle , if you should need anything further , please reach out , as I &apos;m always happy to help !

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! My daughter had an accident with traumatic head injury . I am staying near the Orlando Regional Medical Center ( zip 32806 ) for the next several weeks / months .


I have skipped my next several weeks of Freshly deliveries . Does Freshly deliver to this Orlando area ? If so I would like to continue service once I find suitable housing .


Thank you ,

( 02 : 31 : 22 PM ) Taylor : Hi Casey !

( 02 : 31 : 52 PM ) Taylor : Thanks for reaching out to Freshly ! I &apos;m happy to let you know a bit about how our service works . We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

( 02 : 32 : 15 PM ) Taylor : The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks or cancel the subscription altogether until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us . You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up .

( 02 : 33 : 54 PM ) Casey Timmerman : So my wife and I travel a lot so we wouldn ’ t need meals each week for one or both of us . So you ’ re saying if we ordered one week for delivery , we could skip a week ?

( 02 : 34 : 15 PM ) Taylor : Yes . You can skip a week , typically up to 3 at a time , in order to avoid an unwanted delivery .

( 02 : 34 : 39 PM ) Taylor : If you should need to skip more weeks than what &apos;s available in your meal planner , you could also cancel the subscription until you &apos;re ready to reactivate it .

( 02 : 34 : 47 PM ) Casey Timmerman : And you only bill for the week you send ?

( 02 : 35 : 17 PM ) Taylor : We bill you each week automatically shortly after the close of your weekly deadline . However , if you skip the week prior to that deadline , you avoid a charge altogether .

( 02 : 35 : 48 PM ) Casey Timmerman : Can you give me a for instance scenario ?

( 02 : 35 : 49 PM ) Taylor : If you happen to forget , we also have a small window where you can reach out to us to see if we can then cancel the order on the Freshly end .

( 02 : 36 : 12 PM ) Taylor : If your weekly deadline is each Friday before 2 pm PT , you &apos;ll need to skip the order before then to avoid a charge .

( 02 : 36 : 21 PM ) Casey Timmerman : Gotcha

( 02 : 36 : 30 PM ) Casey Timmerman : Last question ...

( 02 : 36 : 34 PM ) Taylor : Sure !

( 02 : 36 : 47 PM ) Casey Timmerman : How long do the meals last ?

( 02 : 36 : 53 PM ) Casey Timmerman : Typically

( 02 : 37 : 21 PM ) Taylor : The meals will remain fresh in your refrigerator between 3-5 days after they are delivered . You can check the “ use by ” date on a meal ’ s cardboard sleeve for more specifics regarding that meal itself . If you &apos;re unable to get through all of your meals by the &quot; use by &quot; date on the back of each , you &apos;re more than welcome to store them in the freezer to extend the shelf life .

( 02 : 37 : 46 PM ) Casey Timmerman : Thank you for your help .

( 02 : 37 : 51 PM ) Taylor : My pleasure , Casey !

( 02 : 37 : 59 PM ) Taylor : Have a happy New Year and please let me know if I can assist you with anything further ! I &apos;d also appreciate your taking our quick survey about your experience once the chat is over .

( 02 : 38 : 07 PM ) Casey Timmerman : Where is packaging done ?

( 02 : 38 : 43 PM ) Taylor : Our meals are prepared and shipped from Phoenix , AZ . We &apos;re also expanding to the East coast next month - those meals will be prepared and shipped from Savage , MD .

( 02 : 57 : 39 PM ) Aulia : I have placed an order for a scheduled delivery on January 19 , 2019 . My credit card has been charged for this purchase .

But I want to cancel my order because I read the reviews saying that the packaging is bulky , loaded with ice , and would be very heavy . I live on 4th floor at a building with no elevator so I figure it would be just too much hassle to lift the package and get it to my kitchen . I once have a knee and back issue just to lift something heavy so I won ’ t waste my time and money for the risk .

This meal plan is amazing ideas , though ! And I ’ d love to try it shall there ’ s an option of delivery to my door .

Thanks so much for this feedback ! I &apos;d be happy to forward this along , as we often bring back customer favorites . : ) Hello , my name is Heidi Kristina ( Kristie ) McComb .

115 E. 23rd St. , 7th Floor , New York , NY 10010Hi Grant ,

Thanks for reaching out to us today ! I &apos;m so very sorry to hear you never received your Freshly delivery ! We want all of our customers to have a convenient and worry-free experience and are very disappointed this has not been the case for you ! I cannot express my apologies enough , as I can imagine what a huge inconvenience this can be ! As a Freshly customer myself , I too would be upset if I did not receive the meals I was waiting for . Rest assured , this issue has been communicated to our delivery specialist , who will work with our carriers to determine a cause in the hopes of preventing this issue in the future .

As an apology for those spoiled meals , I &apos;ve gone ahead and refunded this most recent charge . Please allow 3-5 business days for your refund of $ 59.99 to return to your card . I ’ ve also placed a $ 20 in house credit on your subscription , so that your next order with us is discounted . The discount is automatically applied , so you won &apos;t have to do anything to receive it , and it will expire if not used within 6 months . Our team will reach out to the carrier to ensure these meals are destroyed , as they would no longer be safe . However if this does not reach them in time and the meals do arrive , please dispose of those meals upon receiving them .

Just as a quick reminder , Freshly is a weekly subscription service , and if you want to make any changes to your upcoming or future orders , your deadline to do so would be Fridays at 5 PM EST .

I hope this helps Grant ! My apologies again for the trouble , and please let me know if you have any further questions !



Fresh wishes ,

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Hi Grant ,

Thanks for your reply ! I do apologize again for the trouble ! Because our meals are sourced and cooked fresh from scratch , our entire process would take several days . This would be why we are unable to send out an expedited order . I do apologize for this ! I do see you currently have Thursday , December 20th skipped , however I &apos;d be happy to unskip the week for you if this works .

As for your issue with your deliveries being left outside your building , I do sincerely apologize for this ! I do see you added a notation to your shipping label , however I did edit it a bit to appear at the top of your shipping label , so that it is noticeable by OnTrac . This way , as long as there is no lock on your building door and mail carriers can get in and out of the building , they should be able to drop the meals off at your door .

I do hope this helps , Grant ! My apologies again for the trouble , and do let me know if you need anything else !

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Our building does have a secure front door . I manage this building but OnTrac tends to just leave packagings outside and no one attempted to deliver yesterday . I was on-site all day . Freshly really should switch delivery companies . It is a known fact that OnTrac is the worst .


Thanks .

Thanks for the quick reply and providing that information ! Is there a buzzer where OnTrac can be buzzed and let in ? If so , then they should be able to make the delivery now that I have made the request to leave meals at your apartment door only more noticeable . I have also ensured this issue was reported over to our team . I &apos;m sorry to say I would not be able to change your carrier , as OnTrac would be the carrier for your area , however I would be happy to forward your feedback along to our team , as we are always looking for ways to improve our service .

I do hope this helps , Grant ! Have a wonderful day !

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Hello ! I signed up for Freshly and tried to use a friend &apos;s referral code . He told me I just needed to enter his email as the referral code but it didn &apos;t accept the discount . I want to make sure both of us get the meal credit - can you please apply his referral to our accounts ? His email is : rhinoman3004 @ msn.com . Thank you ! - RachaelHello Rachael ,

Thanks for your email ! I &apos;m sorry for the friend referral confusion ! I &apos;m afraid the email address does not work as the discount code for friend referrals . Typically , the referring friend would get a special link which you can click on so that both parties get a reward . Please refer to this link for details : Do I get a discount for referring friends ?

As a special courtesy , I manually processed a friend referral reward for the both of you via a $ 20.99 refund and an in-house credit of $ 20.99 which should auto-apply on your next charge . Refunds typically take about 3 - 5 business days to process . Note that all future friend referrals have to be made via the proper link to be valid : https : / / www.freshly.com / refer .

Going forward , just a Freshly reminder that Sunday , before 5 p.m . EST is your deadline to make any changes to your Saturday orders .

Let me know if you need further help , Rachael !

We &apos;re so sorry your delivery was delayed . A note about your delivery

Dear Dan ,

We &apos;ve been advised by our delivery partner that your order didn ’ t arrive yesterday as scheduled . This is definitely not the type of experience we want for our customers .

Because of this delay , your meals will have been unrefrigerated for an amount of time that makes them unsafe to eat . As a result , we have asked the carrier to discard your package , although there &apos;s a chance it will still arrive . If this happens , please dispose of the meals without eating them . Your health is our top priority and we can no longer guarantee the freshness of your order , even if the meals still feel cold .

Please accept our sincere apologies — it &apos;s extremely frustrating to expect to get your meals and then have to make a new plan . Due to this , we &apos;ve given you a 100 % refund for your order ( this should appear in your bank account within five business days ) . Additionally , we &apos;ve added a $ 20 in-store credit to your subscription . This will be valid for six months from now and will automatically apply the next time you &apos;re charged for an order .

Again , we &apos;re so sorry about this and truly appreciate your patience !

Sincerely ,
The Freshly Team

You &apos;re absolutely right that it likely has a lot to do with our carriers currently being in their peak season .

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Hi . I ordered food for next month ( not sure why it takes a month to get your first order ... ) . I am switching to the keto diet and therefore the order I placed and paid for us no longer appropriate . Can you please cancel and refund my order and cancel any future service ?

Sent from my iPhoneHello Sarah ,

Thank you for reaching out to us today .

I am so very sorry regarding the inconvenience regarding the delivery date for your first order . The reason it was a month out is because you are in one of the areas that we will be able to deliver to once our new kitchen on the East coast opens up . This is opening up next month , which is the reason for the January start dates .

With that being said , I have now cancelled the January 9th order and your subscription . Since you were already charged for those meals , I will be issuing you a full refund in the amount of $ 39 . Refunds may take 3-5 business days to completely process , however this can vary depending on your bank .

You will not receive any more charges or shipments from us unless you decide to reactivate your subscription in the future . You can do so by logging in to your meal planner ! The link below will also help explain further how you can reactivate .

How do I reactivate my subscription ?

If there is anything else I can do to help , Sarah , please let me know . I would be happy to assist .

Thank you for reaching out to us and your interest in Freshly !

At this time , all of our meals are made with 100 % gluten free ingredients . This is because we originally created our food philosophy to focus on foods that are naturally gluten free ( think quality proteins , veggies , and healthy fats ) . Because there are many challenges around having both gluten AND gluten free items in our kitchen , we decided to remain entirely gluten free .

But , here ’ s the good news … We ’ re creating very delicious ways to make gluten free good for everyone ! Even though we don ’ t use gluten containing items , we use very high quality ( and tasty ) gluten free pasta and other alternatives . Our customers tell us that they can &apos;t even tell the difference ! The even better news is that most people feel better when eliminating gluten from their diet . All of the nutrients and fiber found in gluten-containing items can be found in other carbohydrates and veggies !

Because you didn &apos;t receive your delivery , I &apos;m afraid your meals would no longer be safe to consume , because they would have been in transit for too long a period . We design our packages to withstand two full days of shipment , plus twelve hours at your doorstep , so anything outside of that time-frame could potentially render the meals unsafe to eat and the meals would have to be discarded . We will try and have the meals disposed of for you .

To further express my apologies , we have issued a full refund in the amount of $ 59.99 to cover the cost of the meals you didn &apos;t receive , and you should see those funds post to your account within 3-5 business days . I &apos;ve also issued an in-house credit in the amount of $ 20 for the inconvenience . This is a one-time credit that will expire in 6 months and will automatically go towards your next charged order .

Just as a friendly FYI , ( or reminder if you already knew ! ) we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Thursday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Friday before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


These are just a few of the really helpful links in our FAQ . You can always access even more information from our FAQ page by clicking on the &quot; Help &quot; tab in the upper right hand corner while logged into your account ! And of course , we are always happy to assist via email , text or phone at 844-FRESHLY or via chat ! Our current hours of operation are from 6am-11pm PT every day .

Once again , my sincere apologies , Ryan ! If you should need anything going forward , I &apos;m always happy to help !

( 04 : 03 : 34 PM ) Marco : This would depend on your location , would I possibly be able to have your zip code ?

( 04 : 03 : 44 PM ) Marco : Thank you !

( 04 : 03 : 46 PM ) Marco : Let me take a look .

( 04 : 04 : 31 PM ) Marco : I &apos;m afraid that the reason the delivery dates only available are in January is due to our current facility in Phoenix , Arizona not being able to service your area , we are waiting for the completion of our new facility in Maryland in order to service your area . This facility is estimated to be completed by early January 2019 .

( 04 : 04 : 50 PM ) Marco : I apologize for the wait Raelynn .

( 04 : 05 : 58 PM ) Raelynn Bertholf : Okay no problem . But once the new facility is Maryland is up and running will the meals come weekly once I am signed up .

( 04 : 06 : 12 PM ) Marco : Yes , that is correct .

( 04 : 06 : 26 PM ) Marco : Once everything is set up fully , your subscription will be a weekly set of meals !

( 04 : 06 : 40 PM ) Raelynn Bertholf : Awesome !

( 04 : 06 : 46 PM ) Marco : Of course !

( 04 : 06 : 49 PM ) Marco : Is there anything else I can assist you with ?

( 04 : 07 : 14 PM ) Raelynn Bertholf : Do you have kid portions ? I have a 1 year old

( 04 : 07 : 30 PM ) Marco : I am afraid that we do not .

( 04 : 07 : 47 PM ) Marco : I apologize , I will definitely provide that feedback to our team !

( 04 : 07 : 57 PM ) Marco : I think it &apos;s definitely a great idea !

( 04 : 21 : 03 PM ) Elizabeth Jakaitis : Hi ! I &apos;ve had a couple of in-store credits and refunds applied to my account and I don &apos;t think all of them have gone through . The problem may be that I &apos;ve somehow ended up with two subscriptions in my name . I &apos;ve been using &quot; My 2nd Subscription &quot; and I see how to delete the other one , but before doing that I wanted to make sure credits haven &apos;t been applied to my other subscription .

Two weeks in a row I had orders that were not delivered on time and needed to be thrown away . I received one email telling me this on 11 / 30 / 18 and it said I &apos;d get a 100 % refund and a $ 20 in-store credit . The next week I got an email on 12 / 6 / 18 saying the same thing and also saying I &apos;d get another 100 % refund and a 50 % off in-store credit . On 12 / 3 / 18 a 100 % refund of $ 49.99 appeared in my bank account , but I never received the other refund that was mentioned in the 12 / 6 / 18 email . Also , the meals I received on 12 / 12 / 18 were 50 % off , but for the meals I will receive on 12 / 19 / 18 I was charged full-price ( $ 49.99 ) . It doesn &apos;t look like the $ 20 in-store credit was ever applied .

I can provide screen shots of the emails if necessary .

Thank you ,

Elizabeth Jakaitis

( 04 : 23 : 41 PM ) Marco : Thank you for your patience !

( 04 : 26 : 20 PM ) Marco : Okay , Elizabeth I do see that the first set of $ 20.00 in-store credit is applied onto your first subscription and not the second subscription .

( 04 : 26 : 41 PM ) Marco : This is why it never applied onto the Wednesday , December 19th order .

( 04 : 26 : 51 PM ) Marco : I sincerely apologize in regards to any confusion with that in-store credit .

( 04 : 27 : 21 PM ) Marco : In regards to the 12 / 6 / 18 order , I am seeing that it was covered fully by the previous in-store credit .

( 04 : 27 : 58 PM ) Marco : What I can do is , I can reapply the in-store credit of $ 49.99 for that order , as I cannot provide a refund due to it being covered fully by in-store credit .

( 04 : 28 : 32 PM ) Marco : Then if you wish to cancel the 1st subscription , I can apply the $ 20.00 in-store credit in this subscription as well .

( 04 : 29 : 27 PM ) Elizabeth Jakaitis : That sounds great , thank you ! Yes , if both of those credits could be applied to my 2nd subscription that would be very helpful . Then I &apos;ll delete the 1st subscription to avoid future confusions ! Thanks again !

( 04 : 29 : 37 PM ) Marco : Okay , give me one moment to finalize !

( 04 : 32 : 33 PM ) Marco : Great ! An in-house credit was added to your subscription to be automatically applied to your next order , in the amount of $ 49.99 plus an additional $ 20.00 . These are one-time credits that expires 6 months from today and will automatically apply toward your next charged orders .

( 04 : 32 : 38 PM ) Marco : Is there anything else I can assist you with ?

( 04 : 32 : 55 PM ) Marco : I have also removed the in-store credit from the 1st subscription .

( 04 : 32 : 43 PM ) Derek : Hey there ,

I see that the the price comes down , per meal , for the plans with more meals . If I were interested in doing something like , let &apos;s say , 24 meals per week could I negotiate a lower rate ? Right now I cook most of my meals and they range anywhere from $ 3- $ 8 per meal . But $ 8 is on the high end and I consider that to be pretty expensive when it comes to meal prepping . Your service sounds fantastic but a little more than I would want to pay for something like 24 meals . Let me know if you can be flexible for large plans . Thanks !

( 04 : 33 : 08 PM ) Kasandra : Hey Derek !

( 04 : 33 : 18 PM ) Kasandra : Thanks for reaching out to Freshly today !

( 04 : 34 : 02 PM ) Kasandra : At this time , the plans you see available on our website are all we offer , however , we do offer an array of promo codes to help with pricing .

( 04 : 34 : 36 PM ) Derek : I assume the promo codes are more like one time opportunities , though ?

( 04 : 34 : 57 PM ) Kasandra : Some of them are , but we regularly add new ones .

( 04 : 35 : 08 PM ) Kasandra : One that is constantly available is referring a friend .

( 04 : 36 : 03 PM ) Kasandra : The way that works is you sign up and send your unique promo link to your friend ( s ) . Once they sign up , they get $ 20 off their first 2 orders and you get an email confirming that you also get $ 20 of your next 2 orders .

( 04 : 37 : 24 PM ) Kasandra : * off

( 04 : 37 : 46 PM ) Derek : Okay , thanks . I would be looking for a consistent discount for ordering a high volume of meals . This company and service sounds great ; but I would recommend building plans with better discounts for higher weekly orders . I &apos;m not sure what the margins look like for you guys but I think that it might make sense to get more orders per week .

( 04 : 38 : 32 PM ) Kasandra : Definitely ! We are looking into finding ways to lower to price per meal . I &apos;d say keep an eye out for that in the future !

( 04 : 38 : 53 PM ) Derek : Will do ! Thanks again

( 04 : 39 : 09 PM ) Kasandra : You &apos;re welcome ! Have a great day !

( 04 : 36 : 21 PM ) Samantha : Hello Wil !

( 04 : 36 : 23 PM ) Samantha : One moment while I pull up your subscription to look into this for you .

( 04 : 36 : 59 PM ) Wil Meggers : Also is it possible for deliveries on Monday or Tuesday ?

( 04 : 37 : 11 PM ) Samantha : When I pull up , I do see that there are 4 meals selected for January 11th . You may have to scroll in the meal planner to view the other selections .

( 04 : 37 : 29 PM ) Wil Meggers : Ok thanks

( 04 : 37 : 49 PM ) Samantha : Monday deliveries are not available in your area , however , Tuesdays are . With that being said , Tuesday deliveries are at capacity in your area during your first two weeks .

( 04 : 38 : 18 PM ) Wil Meggers : How long to the meals last in the refrigerator ?

( 04 : 38 : 34 PM ) Samantha : The meals that we send to customers have a use-by date of about 4 days in the fridge after they are delivered - although the shelf life could vary slightly in some cases . You can check the “ use by ” date on a meal ’ s cardboard sleeve for more specifics regarding that meal itself .

( 04 : 38 : 37 PM ) Samantha : You may , if needed , freeze meals to make them last longer - in which case , when it comes time to heat the meals , simply microwave for one to two minutes from the frozen state prior to following the printed heating instructions .

( 04 : 39 : 33 PM ) Wil Meggers : Ok perfect thank you !

( 04 : 39 : 39 PM ) Samantha : You &apos;re very welcome , Wil !

( 04 : 39 : 50 PM ) Samantha : As a friendly reminder , we are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week .

( 04 : 39 : 52 PM ) Samantha : Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time ?

( 04 : 37 : 18 PM ) Kailey : Hi Janis !

( 04 : 38 : 23 PM ) Kailey : My apologies for any confusion , however the time has indeed changed from 5 PM PST to 2 PM PST . This would be so that our new East Coast kitchen runs on the same schedule as our current Phoenix AZ kitchen . So sorry for any trouble !

( 04 : 39 : 00 PM ) janis hutchinson : Thanks . U have one more question , Wait a second .

( 04 : 39 : 10 PM ) Kailey : Sure thing !

( 04 : 40 : 40 PM ) janis hutchinson : I received an email yesterday that because my dinners scheduled for yesterday were not delivered ( don &apos;t know if they &apos;ll show up today or not ) . It said to not freeze them , but to throw them away . However , the very first order I ever placed with Freshly came a day late and they were just fine . Unless I freeze them ( hopefully , they will arrive today ) , I will be without meals for a week . Is that correct ?

( 04 : 41 : 11 PM ) Kailey : Let me bring up your subscription and check . Just a second !

( 04 : 45 : 07 PM ) Kailey : I do apologize Janis ! I do see this delay on my end as well , and I &apos;m afraid the meals would not be safe to consume if still delivered today . I do apologize ! Our meals are only safe in their packaging for 60 hours , and you are in a two day delivery zone . So if delivered late , the meals would not be safe , and we don &apos;t advise freezing late meals , as we do not want customers to consume spoiled meals and get sick . Let me make sure a refund was taken care of for you for this order .

( 04 : 46 : 14 PM ) janis hutchinson : Okay . Are you resending the same order today ? Or , will I be without meals this week . I just need to know so I can make plans .

( 04 : 47 : 31 PM ) Kailey : I &apos;m afraid that because our meals are cooked from scratch and thus require several days to complete the whole process , we are not able to send out replacement orders . However , your next order is currently set for December 20th , and I have set this order to be free of charge in addition to this refund .

( 04 : 49 : 52 PM ) janis hutchinson : Thank you . Just so I understand : You have set up my Dec. 20th delivery to be the same set of meals scheduled for this week ? And I don &apos;t need to go into the settings to place that order for Dec. 20 ?

( 04 : 50 : 24 PM ) Kailey : Let me check what you have selected for that week .

( 04 : 51 : 29 PM ) Kailey : Yes , you &apos;re receiving the same meals . If you want to change them however , you &apos;d have until today at 2 PM PST to change them since your deadline is Fridays at 2 PM PST .

( 04 : 52 : 09 PM ) janis hutchinson : Okay . Thanks so much for your assistance !

( 04 : 52 : 19 PM ) Kailey : Not a problem at all Janis !

( 04 : 52 : 31 PM ) Kailey : If you should need anything else definitely let me know !

( 05 : 01 : 40 PM ) Russell : Let me check all the options here in terms of helping you .

( 05 : 01 : 52 PM ) mark lamantia : how much is the charge ?

( 05 : 03 : 51 PM ) mark lamantia : i dont understand how you charge me for orderes i have not yet placed

( 05 : 04 : 39 PM ) Russell : We &apos;re a weekly subscription service so we send you meals each week until you skip or cancel by your deadline .

( 05 : 05 : 10 PM ) mark lamantia : but what are you sending if i have not ordered ?

( 05 : 05 : 35 PM ) Russell : The charges are $ 49.99 ( $ 59.99 minus $ 10 in-house credit for an earlier delivery delay ) then $ 39 due to a promo .

( 05 : 05 : 47 PM ) Russell : The system will replicate the previous week &apos;s order .

( 05 : 05 : 52 PM ) Russell : Let me get you a screenshot .

( 05 : 05 : 59 PM ) mark lamantia : no ! !

( 05 : 06 : 07 PM ) mark lamantia : no screenshots

( 05 : 06 : 16 PM ) Russell : Also , as you requested , I &apos;ll keep your subscriptions cancelled . You can always reactivate when you need more meals .

( 05 : 06 : 23 PM ) mark lamantia : if i cant order when i want shut me down

( 05 : 06 : 39 PM ) Russell : I &apos;ll cancel now . I &apos;ll be right back !

( 05 : 08 : 44 PM ) Russell : OK , all subscriptions cancelled , as requested .

( 05 : 09 : 02 PM ) mark lamantia : so what is coming ?

( 05 : 11 : 34 PM ) Russell : Mark , I &apos;m happy to help you but please take note of my replies so there &apos;s no need to repost them repeatedly .

( 05 : 11 : 37 PM ) mark lamantia : again ... the charge

( 05 : 11 : 45 PM ) Russell : Here is what I said earlier : &quot; The charges are $ 49.99 ( $ 59.99 minus $ 10 in-house credit for an earlier delivery delay ) then $ 39 due to a promo . &quot;

( 05 : 11 : 53 PM ) Russell : Please let me know if I can assist you with anything further ! I &apos;d also appreciate your taking our quick survey about your experience once the chat is over .

( 05 : 12 : 21 PM ) mark lamantia : give me total charge that i will see on my acct

( 05 : 13 : 10 PM ) Russell : So that would be $ 49.99 plus $ 39 .

( 05 : 13 : 19 PM ) Russell : $ 88.99 is the total .

( 05 : 13 : 49 PM ) Russell : Let me know if there &apos;s anything else that I can help you with , Mark .

( 05 : 14 : 08 PM ) mark lamantia : ok ... now explain this .. how do i place 2 orders per month .. 6 meals each

( 05 : 15 : 08 PM ) Russell : Our service defaults to a weekly service , I &apos;m afraid .

( 05 : 15 : 26 PM ) Russell : You can do every other week but you would have to manually skip orders on a regular basis .

( 05 : 16 : 09 PM ) Russell : I can note your feedback , though , to our web design team for a more user-friendly experience .

( 05 : 16 : 09 PM ) mark lamantia : ok ... i was already charged the 39 ... you have not explained the 59.99 that i see on my acct ... has that been cancelled

( 05 : 16 : 59 PM ) mark lamantia : well yeh ! let us buy the meals ! novel idea

( 05 : 18 : 37 PM ) Russell : As mentioned earlier , the $ 59.99 charge is for your cancelled Dec. 18th order . This has been refunded per this statement : &quot; OK , good news , Dec. 18th order cancelled then $ 59.99 fully refunded--give it about 3 - 5 business days to process . &quot;

( 05 : 19 : 00 PM ) Russell : Please let me know if I can assist you with anything further ! I &apos;d also appreciate your taking our quick survey about your experience once the chat is over .

( 05 : 19 : 11 PM ) Russell : Have a good one , Mark !

( 05 : 20 : 04 PM ) mark lamantia : you want to hook people in to charges and glue them to their computer to cancel orders ... no email notice ... bad business

( 05 : 20 : 21 PM ) mark lamantia : good food , lousy service

( 05 : 21 : 10 PM ) Russell : No worries , let me refund for the 2nd duplicate order that was mistakenly placed . You should see a refund then of $ 49.99 , that &apos;s in addition to your $ 59.99 refund from earlier .

( 05 : 21 : 32 PM ) mark lamantia : whatever

( 05 : 22 : 02 PM ) Russell : Have a good day , Mark ! I &apos;m sure you have better things to devote your 45 min . to . Take care !

( 04 : 40 : 14 PM ) Adam : I am so sorry for the confusion !

( 04 : 40 : 44 PM ) Adam : We are actually opening our Maryland kitchen in a couple of weeks , which is why you see the January date as the first available .

( 04 : 41 : 16 PM ) Sarah Laubach : Ooooo I see ! Looks like I joined at the right time ! Do the meals need to stay frozen when I receive them , or will they stay fresh being refrigerated ?

( 04 : 41 : 24 PM ) Sarah Laubach : Thank you for clarifying that !

( 04 : 42 : 21 PM ) Adam : Right time indeed ! -They are delicious too !

( 04 : 42 : 32 PM ) Adam : Our meals are designed to be refrigerated to preserve their freshness , but we understand that life happens and you are not always able to eat them right away . Therefore , if freezing is necessary , you can indeed freeze the meals . If you do go the freezing route , please follow these heating instructions : 1 . Do not defrost . 2 . Microwave for 1 min from frozen state . 3 . Follow original heating instructions provided .

( 04 : 43 : 24 PM ) Adam : Because meals are always fresh and free from preservatives , all of our meals have a use by date of 4-5 days from when you receive them .

( 04 : 43 : 35 PM ) Sarah Laubach : Ok thank you ! So excited to get started !

( 04 : 43 : 59 PM ) Adam : We &apos;re excited to have you try them too !

( 04 : 46 : 16 PM ) Samantha : I am so very sorry to hear this .

( 04 : 46 : 19 PM ) Samantha : One moment while I pull up your subscription to look into this for you .

( 04 : 47 : 03 PM ) Samantha : I do see that you have skipped the previous two weeks , however , December 18th was not skipped which is why you have been charged for that order . With that being said , I have time to cancel the meals for you .

( 04 : 47 : 10 PM ) Samantha : When will you be returning from your travels ?

( 04 : 50 : 20 PM ) Samantha : Are you still there , Don ?

( 04 : 51 : 41 PM ) Don Abell : yes

( 04 : 52 : 16 PM ) Samantha : I would love to be able to help make sure you do not receive an order while you are out of town . What day will you return so we can skip weeks until then ?

( 04 : 52 : 34 PM ) Don Abell : Returning after the new year . I will need to skip several more weeks , but on the site they won &apos;t let you skip ahead that far .

( 04 : 52 : 54 PM ) Don Abell : Can I put it on a perm hold without canceling altogether ?

( 04 : 52 : 54 PM ) Samantha : We are able to skip through January 15th on my end .

( 04 : 53 : 26 PM ) Don Abell : Ok , please cancel through 1 / 15 / 19 . I assume they will send me a reminder email when it &apos;s time to order again ? Thanks .

( 04 : 53 : 39 PM ) Samantha : I can cancel your subscription completely for you if you would like . This is essentially like pausing it , as you are able to reactivate at any time .

( 04 : 53 : 45 PM ) Samantha : We do send out weekly deadline reminder emails .

( 04 : 53 : 55 PM ) Don Abell : Can you send me a confirmation email of this chat ? Thanks .

( 04 : 54 : 03 PM ) Samantha : I can do that as well .

( 04 : 54 : 24 PM ) Samantha : I have now cancelled your December 18th order . Since you were already charged for those meals , I will be adding a 100 % in-store credit worth $ 59.99 to cover the cost of these meals . This credit will be automatically applied to your next charge with us and will be available for a one time use within the next 6 months .

( 04 : 55 : 46 PM ) Don Abell : I dont want a credit as I &apos;m not sure when I &apos;ll be back . I need a refund .

( 04 : 55 : 59 PM ) Samantha : Okay . Please give me one moment to fix this for you .

( 04 : 56 : 37 PM ) Samantha : I have now removed the in-store credit from your subscription and issued you a full refund in the amount of $ 59.99 instead . Refunds may take 3-5 business days to completely process , however this can vary depending on your bank .

( 04 : 57 : 11 PM ) Don Abell : ok , and you have me perm on hold with my subscription ?

( 04 : 57 : 32 PM ) Samantha : At this time , orders through January 15th have been skipped . More orders will be added as time goes on .

( 04 : 57 : 38 PM ) Samantha : Are you wanting your subscription cancelled ?

( 04 : 57 : 52 PM ) Don Abell : Thank you . Please send me an email confirmation of our discussion .

( 04 : 58 : 28 PM ) Samantha : I &apos;m sorry . I just want to clarify . Is skipping through January 15th okay ? Or would you like the subscription cancelled to automatically skip all future orders until you are ready to reactivate ?

( 05 : 00 : 12 PM ) Samantha : Just checking in . Are you still with me , Don ?

I &apos;m going to be forwarding this to our delivery team to look into , as they &apos;d be able to check the gps with the carrier to see if the meals were left at a neighbors or somewhere else instead . In the meantime , I have placed a 100 % credit on your subscription , which would set your next order to be free of charge .

( 04 : 49 : 57 PM ) Phil : I was told your gift certificate portal was going live today .... I want to give a very sick person a gift to help nourish them during the healing process

( 04 : 50 : 25 PM ) Kasandra : I &apos;m sorry for any confusion regarding gift certificates !

( 04 : 51 : 34 PM ) Kasandra : We were initially told they were going live today , but there was a decision to slightly postpone it . We are looking at having the option live before the end of the month , with the possibility of as soon as tomorrow .

( 04 : 52 : 06 PM ) Phil : grrrrrrrr ! any other way to handle getting meals for this person setup ?

( 04 : 52 : 30 PM ) Kasandra : You can order a subscription for someone else using your information and set the gift recipient ’ s address as the shipping address on the subscription . This would ensure that you are charged for the subscription , but that the gift recipient is the one who gets the meals .

( 04 : 52 : 34 PM ) Phil : I truly are a fan of your food versus wanting to deal with another vendor

( 04 : 53 : 01 PM ) Kasandra : We appreciate that , and again , Phil , I &apos;m sorry if we gave you false hope regarding gift certificates .

( 04 : 53 : 41 PM ) Phil : the issue is , not sure what and when they will want based on their personal needs .

( 04 : 53 : 57 PM ) Kasandra : Ah . I see .

( 04 : 55 : 03 PM ) Kasandra : There is the option that you can share your log in info with them and have them make the selections they want , as long as they do so by their weekly deadline , they can change anything for their weekly order .

( 04 : 56 : 17 PM ) Kasandra : I don &apos;t know if the situation permits , but you can always check back with us to see if gift certificates are available within the coming days .

( 04 : 59 : 22 PM ) janis hutchinson : I just made changes for my Dec. 20th delivery . After I &quot; saved , &quot; a box asked me if I wanted to apply that change to future deliveries . It &apos;s confusing . If I say yes , to apply to future deliveries , does that mean I am locked into having the same meals for weeks thereafter ? Or , by saying no , does that still save what I just changed for my Dec. 20th delivery ? Not sure what to check , as I will probably change meals every time .

( 04 : 59 : 27 PM ) * * * Kailey joined the chat * * *

( 04 : 59 : 37 PM ) Kailey : Hi Janis !

( 05 : 00 : 37 PM ) Kailey : That is what that means , however you can very easily change the menu for the following week even if you hit yes . This just serves as a default menu , in case you happen to forget to update your meals for a week , the order would contain your default menu meals .

( 05 : 01 : 53 PM ) janis hutchinson : Okay . Thanks . If I have a suggestion for your website , can you pass it on ? If so , I &apos;ll make my suggestion in this chat box .

( 05 : 02 : 20 PM ) Kailey : You can send any suggestions our way and we &apos;d be happy to forward them along !

( 05 : 04 : 47 PM ) janis hutchinson : Okay . Here it is : On the page that shows all the available dishes , it would be helpful if the word &quot; spicy &quot; could be placed under the description . I know it is mentioned if you click on each dish and go to the list of ingredients , but that is time-consuming for those of us on a tight schedule . I do not care for any of the spicy flavors you add to some dishes , so want to avoid them .

( 05 : 05 : 35 PM ) janis hutchinson : I wasn &apos;t clear . I meant to put &quot; spicy &quot; under only those that are spicy .

( 05 : 06 : 02 PM ) Kailey : I can definitely forward this along . Currently , there is a badge depicting a chili pepper that will say spicy when you hover over it , but I can definitely forward this along .

( 05 : 06 : 45 PM ) janis hutchinson : Oh , I will experiment by hovering . I &quot; ll try it . Thanks . Signing off now .

( 05 : 07 : 11 PM ) Kailey : Not a problem Have a wonderful day !

( 05 : 11 : 13 PM ) janis hutchinson : I just hovered my mouse over every meal , and nothing popped up suggesting whether it was spicy or not . And I specifically focused on those I know are spicy . If that it supposed to be a feature , it is not working . You might want to pass that on .

( 05 : 12 : 12 PM ) Kailey : My apologies ! Were you hovering over the badge or the meal itself ? You would need to hover the badge for a second , as it would pop up with a text saying &quot; spicy &quot; . My apologies if my previous instructions weren &apos;t clear !

( 05 : 12 : 40 PM ) janis hutchinson : I don &apos;t know what you mean by &quot; badge &quot; . I just hovered over the picture of the meal .

( 05 : 13 : 22 PM ) Kailey : If you go to our menu page , or if you are editing your meals , you would see small pictures under the meal pictures . These would be the badges .

( 05 : 13 : 49 PM ) janis hutchinson : I &quot; ll try that .

( 05 : 15 : 24 PM ) Marco : If you would like , I can update the meals on my end .

( 05 : 15 : 29 PM ) Marco : I would just need to know which ones !

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Hi , I just made my first order with you . I &apos;d like to start deliveries ASAP , but the only option I &apos;m seeing , that it gave me , was January 22 . How do I start this Monday ? Hello there ! Thanks for reaching out to Freshly ! I &apos;m terribly sorry , but it seems like January 22nd might be the soonest we can get meals out toy our area . I &apos;m afraid it takes several days for our production facility to prepare and cook meals for shipment , so we would not be able to get meals out to you by Monday . What is your zip code , please ?

Customer Care SpecialistI am recovering from a hospital stay and I received one week &apos;s delivery and for some reason can &apos;t get delivery until the 9th of January . It would be really awesome to get a delivery before then . I love your food .

Also I had a promo for the first week as a new subscriber and I now see that you are advertising a two week discount promo , can you extend the promo for the second week to my subscription ? Hey Nikki ,

Thank you for reaching out to Freshly .

I &apos;m so sorry , that the holiday weeks have caused an interruption to your orders . I took a look at your subscription to see what I could do . My apologies , I didn &apos;t have anything sooner than the 9th . This is partially due to the holiday , but the other reason is that you are in a two day zone . We only deliver to that area Wed - Sat , so I couldn &apos;t get the next delivery moved up .

In light of the inconvenience , I &apos;ve extended your promo for 2 more weeks ! Your next two billed orders will be reduced by $ 20 each . I &apos;m very sorry that I couldn &apos;t get you anything sooner , but I hope this discount helps ! 😊

I &apos;m glad you &apos;re enjoying the food Nikki . Wishing you a speedy recovery from the Freshly Team !

Thank you for contacting me , I have started using weight watchers and the meals I have gotten from freshly I was using for quick lunches , they were fantastic tasting however they cost me anywhere from 14 to 18 points out of my 28 point day . Which I just did not want to lose . : ( I was really hoping to keep my points more around the 8 to 10 range .


I really appreciate you contacting me !


Have a Happy New Year !

Hello Jody !

I ’ m Brooke , the Head of Nutrition at Freshly . I saw you canceled your subscription recently because of concerns about calories , and I just wanted to help address some of the questions you may have .

We know that calories are important for our customers . ( It ’ s our number one most requested nutritional question . ) That ’ s why we design more than half of our menu to to be under 500 calories per dish , while still weighing about 1.5 to 2 times more than our competitors !

While many folks focus on calories to determine if a meal is right for them , we believe that not all calories are created equal . For example , the nutrition in 100 calories of roasted carrots is much different than what comes in 100 calories of junk food or candy . We ’ re proud that the calories in our meals come from our nutrient-dense ingredients , healthy fats , and high-quality proteins .

If you ’ d like to give us another try , I &apos;d also be happy to give you $ 10 off your next order ! Just reactivate your subscription by clicking here , go to &quot; Subscription Settings &quot; , and add the code freshconnect689453 to your subscription ! The code will be valid through December 31st .

Additionally , I ’ d love to chat further about fitting Freshly into your lifestyle ! Let me know if you ’ d like to connect before giving us another chance .

Fresh wishes ,

Brooke S.

Head of NutritionHi Jody ,

Thanks for the reply !

We certainly understand and appreciate you giving us a try . We are always looking for new ways to revamp our meals and new ideas . I will be sure to pass your feedback for lower calorie meals to the correct parties . We wish nothing but success on your weight loss journey !

Have a great day !

I ’ m so very sorry to hear that you didn &apos;t receive your package as scheduled , especially since this is not the first time it has happened ! I can certainly understand your frustration . I &apos;m a Freshly customer as well , and I &apos;m very dependent on getting those weekly meals ! While incidents such as these are out of the norm , they can sometimes happen . I have reported this issue to our Delivery Specialist for further investigation into the cause of this delay . I know that during the holiday season , the carriers have a higher amount of packages to deliver , so that might be the cause of this delay .

To further express my apologies , I have issued a full refund in the amount of $ 9.99 to cover the cost of the meals you didn &apos;t receive , and you should see those funds post to your account within 3-5 business days . I &apos;ve also applied an in-house credit in the amount of $ 60.00 for the inconvenience . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically apply toward your next charged order .

Please be aware that those meals are considered spoiled at this point and will need to be disposed of . I certainly don &apos;t want you to risk getting sick by eating any !

Once again , my sincere apologies Phyllis , and if you should need anything going forward , I &apos;m always happy to help !

( 03 : 23 : 34 PM ) Taylor : I &apos;m sorry to hear that , Lori . Since there &apos;s no active subscription , I can &apos;t see any of your info . We service your area and if you &apos;re using a valid payment method , a change of browser may help . If anything , I may suggest reaching out to the card issuer to see if there &apos;s any reason they &apos;re not authorizing the payment . We usually find one of those reasons to be the cause of customers being unable to proceed with submitting the order .

( 03 : 25 : 34 PM ) Taylor : Please let me know if I can assist you with anything further ! I &apos;d also appreciate your taking our quick survey about your experience once the chat is over .

My daughter has Celiac Disease , and I have been looking for a meal delivery service that is certified ( with no chance of cross-contamination ) for our family .

I spoke with someone at a booth at the Gluten-Free Expo this year in San Mateo and am wondering if this was Freshly ?

Please let me know .

Thank you so much .

( 03 : 38 : 21 PM ) Taylor : Thanks for reaching out to Freshly ! At this time , all of our meals are made with 100 % gluten free ingredients . This is because we originally created our food philosophy to focus on foods that are naturally gluten free ( think quality proteins , veggies , and healthy fats ) .

Because there are many challenges around having both gluten AND gluten free items in our kitchen , we decided to remain entirely gluten free .

( 03 : 38 : 44 PM ) Taylor : We &apos;re also certified by the “ Gluten Intolerance Group ” ( GIG ) 🙂

( 03 : 39 : 00 PM ) Stephanie : This is all such great news !

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Hi ,

I had a thought occur to me when evaluating your service and I wondered if you could help provide me insight as to whether this could work or not - more often than not , i may end up doing business travel to another locatoin for a week , and it would be enormously beneficial for me to use Freshly so I can focus on work while traveling .

How does freshly work with changes to shipping addresses for a week suddenly ( say for one week and then changing it back after receiving that week &apos;s meals .

Its slightly off center of a question , but I would hope you could advise .

Thanks ,

Martin ZajacHi Martin ,

Thanks for reaching out to us !

I certainly understand your concerns while traveling ! We will be servicing 48 states in January . However if you travel to Alaska or Hawaii we wouldn &apos;t be able to provide any meals .

As long as you update your delivery information with a new address a week in advance or at least by your weekly deadline there shouldn &apos;t be any issues with getting your meals out to you . We have a few customers that travel a lot for work as well and we always try our best to make sure we can accommodate their needs .

I hope this information was helpful ! Please feel free to reach out !

( 05 : 02 : 36 PM ) Marco : Hello Ronald !

( 05 : 03 : 32 PM ) Marco : We don &apos;t have trial options , so if you want to gift two weeks only you &apos;ll just need to cancel the subscription after the second order has been shipped . If you &apos;re ordering more than one week , you could share the login details with the recipient so they can make changes to their future orders ! The deadline to cancel or edit meals prior to the second order being charged will also be listed in your Welcome Email !

( 05 : 04 : 47 PM ) Ronald : so it has to be 2 consecutive weeks ?

( 05 : 04 : 54 PM ) Marco : You could do one week as well .

( 05 : 05 : 11 PM ) Marco : The same would apply , that the cancellation would need to be done after the order ships .

( 05 : 05 : 31 PM ) Marco : You are free to cancel at anytime , we just need to make sure to get the orders cancelled as well if they are not wanted .

( 05 : 06 : 06 PM ) Ronald : Can ’ t I just buy them credit and the orders will stop once that runs out ?

( 05 : 06 : 29 PM ) Marco : I apologize we do not currently offer an option like that .

( 05 : 46 : 57 PM ) Kailey : Hi Erica !

( 05 : 47 : 18 PM ) Kailey : My apologies for any trouble ! So you &apos;re saying when you click the &quot; get $ 40 &quot; nothing happens ?

( 05 : 53 : 01 PM ) Kailey : If you need anything else later definitely let me know !

( 05 : 55 : 22 PM ) Erica Reid-Dixon : yes

( 05 : 55 : 24 PM ) Erica Reid-Dixon : thats correct

( 05 : 55 : 36 PM ) Erica Reid-Dixon : it doesn &apos;t activate or direct me anywhere

( 05 : 56 : 39 PM ) Kailey : Got it ! Do you happen to have a pop up blocker on our site ? Since this box does come up as a pop up , this could be the issue as your security settings would block it .

( 05 : 56 : 50 PM ) Erica Reid-Dixon : oh let me see

( 05 : 57 : 11 PM ) Kailey : You can temporarily remove it , and then put it back once you &apos;ve sent off your referrals

( 05 : 58 : 42 PM ) Erica Reid-Dixon : hmm normally in chrome it tells me when its blocking a popup

( 05 : 58 : 50 PM ) Erica Reid-Dixon : all its showing is the sign for cookie blocks

( 05 : 59 : 23 PM ) Kailey : Okay that &apos;s odd. and does anything happen at all when you click this link : freshly.com / refer

( 05 : 59 : 55 PM ) Erica Reid-Dixon : it takes me to a page but theres nothing on it

( 06 : 00 : 04 PM ) Erica Reid-Dixon : the box is just all grey

( 06 : 01 : 22 PM ) Kailey : Okay that &apos;s strange . Usually disabling the pop up blocker works . Did you know who you wanted to refer ? I can send the referrals for you from my end . Once I do this it &apos;ll also provide me with a social sharing link that you can just send to people as well so you don &apos;t have to deal with this later .

( 06 : 03 : 10 PM ) Erica Reid-Dixon : yea I do !

( 06 : 03 : 21 PM ) Erica Reid-Dixon : it &apos;s my colleague who &apos;s been seeing me eat them at work !

( 06 : 04 : 06 PM ) Kailey : Great ! If you can send me their emails I can send the referral for you on your behalf .

( 06 : 04 : 59 PM ) Erica Reid-Dixon : pbalderson @ gmail.com

( 06 : 05 : 14 PM ) Kailey : Okay one moment !

( 06 : 07 : 14 PM ) Kailey : Okay I just sent that , and here &apos;s your personalized share link : http : / / refer.freshly.com / s / m085412

( 06 : 11 : 37 PM ) Erica Reid-Dixon : no i think that &apos;s all ! SO I can send that link to other friends if they ask then ?

( 05 : 56 : 33 PM ) Marco : Let me take a look .

( 05 : 58 : 18 PM ) Marco : I am afraid , that due to it being the first order I cannot make that change .

( 05 : 58 : 22 PM ) Marco : I sincerely apologize Jenniger .

( 05 : 58 : 29 PM ) Marco : Jennifer * I am sorry about that .

( 05 : 59 : 45 PM ) Jennifer Andrew : Um , ok . Well can I cancel my order and start over ?

( 05 : 59 : 50 PM ) Marco : Okay , definitely .

( 06 : 00 : 11 PM ) Marco : I can cancel this order and issue an-store credit to be applied onto your next order or would you prefer a refund ?

( 06 : 01 : 01 PM ) Jennifer Andrew : A credit is fine .

( 06 : 01 : 06 PM ) Marco : Okay , definitely !

( 06 : 02 : 11 PM ) Marco : Okay , I have cancelled the order to arrive on Saturday , January 12th . Also , an in-house credit was added to your subscription to be automatically applied to your next order , in the amount of $ 49.99 for the cost of the meals . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically apply toward your next charged order .

( 06 : 02 : 25 PM ) Marco : The next order is now Saturday , January 19th !

( 06 : 04 : 26 PM ) Jennifer Andrew : ok , so I can just go place that order now ?

( 06 : 04 : 38 PM ) Marco : Yes , you can update the order for January 19th !

( 06 : 04 : 54 PM ) Marco : Or if you &apos;d like I can update that for you ?

( 06 : 05 : 14 PM ) Marco : I can also see if we have a sooner date available for the January 19th order .

( 06 : 05 : 46 PM ) Jennifer Andrew : sure you can change the order . I &apos;d take an earlier date if it &apos;s available .

( 06 : 05 : 54 PM ) Marco : Okay , let me take a look .

( 06 : 06 : 11 PM ) Marco : Just a friendly reminder , we are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week ! Based on your selected delivery day of Saturday , your weekly deadline is Sunday by 2 PM PST !

( 06 : 07 : 57 PM ) Marco : I sincerely apologize Jennifer , I was not able to find an earlier date . I have , however , updated the meals to 12 now , and I would recommend going through and updating to the meals you would delivered !

( 06 : 10 : 43 PM ) Marco : Is there anything else I can assist you with ?

( 06 : 10 : 52 PM ) Jennifer Andrew : Sorry , I &apos;m confused . Don &apos;t I need 16 meals a week ?

( 06 : 11 : 05 PM ) Marco : I apologize for any confusion .

( 06 : 11 : 11 PM ) Marco : Freshly currently offers four different meal plans for 4 , 6 , 9 , and 12 meals per week .

( 06 : 11 : 44 PM ) Marco : The highest meal plan that we would have is 12 , you can however , create an additional subscription and add an extra 4 meal plan to make the 16 meals .

( 06 : 13 : 26 PM ) Marco : Are you still with me Jennifer ?

( 06 : 14 : 27 PM ) Jennifer Andrew : yeah. i &apos;m trying to figure out if that will feed my family or four or not. i &apos;m confused. maybe I just want a refund .

( 06 : 14 : 42 PM ) Marco : Okay , I sincerely apologize .

( 06 : 15 : 10 PM ) Marco : Please let me know how you would like to proceed .

( 06 : 15 : 30 PM ) Jennifer Andrew : just cancel and refund .

( 06 : 15 : 36 PM ) Marco : Okay , definitely .

( 06 : 15 : 38 PM ) Marco : Give me one moment .

( 06 : 16 : 11 PM ) Marco : A $ 49.99 refund was issued back to your card for what you paid . Please allow 3 to 5 business days for that refund to post .

( 06 : 16 : 19 PM ) Marco : I &apos;ve now cancelled your subscription for you , so you shouldn &apos;t receive any further charges or deliveries from us , unless you log back in and reactivate your subscription .

( 06 : 16 : 22 PM ) Marco : Reactivating your subscription is quite simple ! Here is a link with the brief instructions if you decide to reactivate in the future : https : / / support.freshly.com / hc / en-us / articles / 115005366527-How-do-I-reactivate-my-subscription-

Thank you so much for reaching out to us , and for your interest in Freshly !

I &apos;m sorry to hear that you aren &apos;t able to sign up with us yet . However , I can provide you with a promo code that would automatically give you $ 20.00 off your first two weeks with us , when you are ready to sign up ! After those first two weeks , you &apos;d then be charged the regular price of $ 59.99 under the 6 meal plan . The code you can apply is : fb40 .

We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help you manage a subscription if you decide you &apos;d like to give us a try :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


I hope this helps , Angie , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

Customer Care SpecialistThis morning on a morning talk show and--as is the case since his death--there &apos;s a lot of conversation about President George H. W. Bush . Bill Bennett , who served under GHWB , was being interviewed . One of the questions that the commentator asked was : &quot; How would you compare George Herbert Walker Bush to Donald Trump ? ”

I think Dr.Bennett ’ s response was brilliant when he replied : &quot; ... the world is an ever-changing place . Sometimes you need Mother Theresa and sometimes you need Dirty Harry . &quot;

That sure sums it up.Hi

I have referred a friend

Jackie Hines

Bonita5150 @ sbcglobal.net

916 600 3652

Sent from my iPhoneHello Mary ,

Thank you for reaching out to us !

I do apologize , as I am not able to find a subscription for Jackie Hines as there is no subscription pulling up in our system with her full name , email address or the phone number that you provided . However , we were able to find a referral code &quot; advo40fa5fe996972781 &quot; for referring Bridget _ carpenter @ sbcglobal.net to us . Since your subscription is cancelled , I am not able to manually apply this referral code for you to receive your referral credit for 2 weeks of $ 20 off .

Below , I &apos;ve included a helpful link on how to apply a referral / promo code onto your subscription manually :

How do I apply a promo code as a current customer ?

I hope this helps Mary , and if you should need anything further , please reach out , as I &apos;m always happy to help !

Thank you for your response !

I &apos;m terribly sorry , but my supervisor did go ahead and double check again in our system and no referral link was sent to Jackie Hines Bonita5150 @ sbcglobal.net . If you entered in your email address on the first line and then her email address on the second line once you clicked on the &quot; Get $ 40 &quot; link on our website and clicked &quot; send email &quot; then she would have then received the email of your referral . Once she clicks on the email that you sent her and signs up with your personalized link , you will then receive your separate email with your own referral code to apply onto your subscription . Since I was not able to find her subscription in our system with the information that you provided to me , that means that she has not signed up with us yet .

Once again , my sincerest apologies for any inconvenience or confusion this may have caused you and please do reach back out if you should need further assistance , as I &apos;d be more than happy to help !

Customer Care SpecialistThat is exactly what I did Is a requirement ?
I did give my E second line her E and clicked / tapped what ever I backed it up with all her contact info
Does Freshly want the customer or not ? If not let me know .
Enough time at this point has been wasted dont you think .
I know you have all her contact info from the E i sent
If she isnt contacted today I will let her know to choose another .
Know wonder Freshly is rated # 4 on list of these companies ! A shame

Thanks for the reply !

In order to get the referral your friend needs to sign up . We have checked numerous times on her first and last name and the email address you &apos;ve provided for us . Nothing is in our system for your friend has populated . We &apos;ve even had supervisors double check and nothing has populated . Unfortunately at this time you can ask Jackie if she tried to sign up with a different email . If there is a chance she signed up with a different email we will still be more than happy to honor the friend referral . However at this time she hasn &apos;t signed up . I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused !

It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


These are just a few of the really helpful links in our FAQ .

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Hello ,


I have been unable to get a response via chat and now unable to log into my account despite trying to reset my information for the past two weeks . I am hoping for assistance in canceling my account after I received my first shipment and unfortunately two of the meals made me very sick within hours of eating them . I tried to log-in and cancel my account before the next shipment and was unable to do so with every avenue and was intern sent the same items the following week which I couldn ’ t risk eating . I was really looking forward to an easy method of nutritious meals but I don ’ t think we are a match , which is too bad because I really like Freshly ’ s concept . Please let me know the steps I need to take to insure I won ’ t be charged or sent any more meal boxes . Thank you !

I hope you are doing well today . I wanted to connect again , as we have not been able to get in touch regarding your experience with our service .

This would go a long way towards helping us conduct a full and thorough investigation and reporting the issue properly .


What day and time did you retrieve the package at your home ?
When you retrieved the package and touched the meals , were they cool to the touch ?
From where did you retrieve the package ? Stoop … porch … yard ?
Was the box damaged in anyway ?
What was the condition of the gel packs ? Hard , mostly melted ?
Was the film on all the meals secure ?
Did you ever freeze the meal / s ?
How did you prepare the food ? Microwave , oven , stovetop ?
For how long did you heat the meal ?
After reading the ingredients on the package , is there anything to which you are allergic ?
On which date / time were the above meal / s consumed ?


What were the symptoms of the illness ?
What was the onset time of symptoms after consumption ?
For how long did the symptoms last ?
Was medical attention necessary - and , if so , what was required ?


If you would be able to answer these questions , it would be greatly appreciated .

( 06 : 33 : 25 PM ) Adam : You can typically view up to three weeks in advance !

( 06 : 33 : 52 PM ) Patricia : I am scheduled for a delivery Jan 19th but have skipped the week after that . I don &apos;t see anything beyond that .

( 06 : 34 : 05 PM ) Adam : We are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged ) meals on a weekly basis .

In your subscription , you are able to plan out your menus for up to three weeks in advance .

( 06 : 36 : 17 PM ) Patricia : I have downloaded the app .

( 06 : 36 : 27 PM ) Adam : We have an App , that will notify you to make the changes prior to the deadline !

( 06 : 37 : 32 PM ) Patricia : Pretty sure I signed up for that but think it would be far easier to be able to pause subscription when needed and just re-up when ready .

( 06 : 38 : 11 PM ) Adam : You can always call us to temporarily &quot; Cancel &quot; and Reactivate when you are ready .

( 06 : 38 : 18 PM ) Patricia : Seems like it would give you folks more info as well about future needs .

Thanks for reaching out to us today !

At the moment , I am unable to cancel your subscription , as this would cancel your first order since the order is still very far out . I do apologize for this ! However , I have made a note in our system for your subscription to be cancelled on Thursday , January 17th , the date of your first order , so that you receive nothing else after that unless you reactivated your subscription . I have set this up internally , so there is nothing you need to do .

I do hope this helps , Jim ! If you should need anything else , please let me know !

( 04 : 09 : 09 PM ) Adam : Freshly currently offers four different meal plans for 4 , 6 , 9 , and 12 meals per week .

( 04 : 09 : 14 PM ) Adam : These are priced at $ 49.99 , $ 59.99 , $ 89.99 , and $ 107.99 , respectively . Your plan of choice will arrive in a single shipment each week .

( 04 : 09 : 57 PM ) Ana : I signup with a coupon for 6 meals for $ 39.99 but I don ’ t see how much after the two weeks for $ 39.99

( 04 : 10 : 25 PM ) Adam : It would be 59.99 after the promotion .

( 04 : 10 : 53 PM ) Ana : sounds good . Can I change it to 4 meals a week after my 2 weeks ?

( 04 : 10 : 58 PM ) Adam : We are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged ) meals on a weekly basis .

In your subscription , you are able to plan out your menus for up to three weeks in advance .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Monday , any changes to your weekly order , or if you decide to skip the week , would need to be made by Wednesday , prior to 2 pm PT .

( 04 : 11 : 15 PM ) Adam : Yes , you can change your plan at any time .

( 04 : 11 : 32 PM ) Ana : Awesome ! Thanks !

( 04 : 11 : 47 PM ) Adam : You &apos;re welcome , Ana !

( 04 : 11 : 50 PM ) Adam : Is there anything else I can assist you with ?

( 04 : 12 : 04 PM ) Ana : No , thank you !

( 04 : 12 : 26 PM ) Adam : Please let me know if I can assist you with anything further ! I &apos;d also appreciate your taking our quick survey about your experience once the chat is over .

( 04 : 11 : 08 PM ) Taylor : Hi Michelle !

( 04 : 11 : 13 PM ) Michelle : hello

( 04 : 11 : 50 PM ) Taylor : Thanks for reaching out to Freshly ! We only forecast up to 3 weeks in advance from the current date so depending on when your first order is scheduled , you may have to wait a week or so for more weeks to populate for edits .

( 04 : 11 : 52 PM ) Taylor : Could you please verify the phone number associated with the subscription ?

( 04 : 12 : 01 PM ) Michelle : 5154089448

( 04 : 12 : 07 PM ) Taylor : Thanks ! Just a moment , pleasae .

( 04 : 12 : 09 PM ) Taylor : * please

( 04 : 13 : 23 PM ) Taylor : Thanks for your patience , Michelle ! Since your first order isn &apos;t scheduled until January 22nd , you won &apos;t yet see future weeks for the reasoning explained above . As we get closer to that date , you &apos;ll start seeing more future weeks populate in your meal planner .

( 04 : 13 : 32 PM ) Michelle : ok , thank you

( 04 : 13 : 38 PM ) Taylor : My pleasure ! Just as a friendly reminder , we are a weekly subscription service by nature . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis .

Is there anything else I can assist with today ?

( 04 : 14 : 24 PM ) Michelle : Is there a way to move up my first delivery or is Jan 22 the first available

( 04 : 14 : 37 PM ) Taylor : That &apos;s the soonest available

( 04 : 14 : 59 PM ) Michelle : Ok , that is all for the day then . Thank you for answering my questions . Happy New Year

( 04 : 59 : 18 PM ) Taylor : Thanks for reaching out to Freshly ! We don &apos;t have meals that are specifically made for diabetics , but we have quite a few customers that order from us who are diabetic . This is mainly because we do not use any refined sugars , and focus on low-glycemic carb meals ( or simply low-carb meals ) . We always recommend that anyone with a pre-existing medical condition speak to their doctor before enjoying our meals to be sure you would be getting the proper nutrition for your dietary needs .

( 04 : 59 : 54 PM ) Taylor : Your nutrition / ingredient-related questions might also be better answered by one of our Wellness Experts ; they have educational backgrounds in nutrition and will be able to answer your question more thoroughly .

I will not need a delivery next week and I ’ m not sure I ’ m going to continue . Well I guess I can ’ t send the photo from email so will send a text to the general number .

115 E. 23rd St. , 7th Floor , New York , NY 10010Hello Jorge ,

Thank you for taking the time to get in touch , and my apologies for the inconvenience !

The order for December 13th had a $ 30 in-house credit applied to it , which would make the total charge $ 29.99 . However , I see that there was a promotion attached to the order there , and as such , in order to keep the value of that promotion , I &apos;ve refunded the remaining $ 29.99 here , which should arrive back within 3-5 business days , depending on bank policy . You won &apos;t have to do anything further to receive it there .

Going forward from here , future orders in this subscription would be at the regular rate of $ 59.99 per week .

Just as a quick reminder , we are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing any upcoming week ! Your weekly deadline to edit your meals or skip a week is 2 : 00 pm PT every Friday .

UnsubscribeHi Emily ,

Thank you so much for reaching out to Freshly ! I &apos;m so sorry for any confusion regarding the ingredients , and I &apos;d be happy to assist !

Groats are a real food , despite their funny name . They can be made from any grain kernel , but in our Southwest Chicken Bowl , they &apos;re made from Buckwheat , a type of seed ( not actually wheat ) . They &apos;re a great gluten-free food pull of protein and fiber !

Since you are interest in Freshly , I wanted to let you know that we are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help you manage a subscription if you decide you &apos;d like to give us a try :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


I hope this helps , Emily , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

Have a wonderful day !

115 E. 23rd St. , 7th Floor , New York , NY 10010Hello Cheri ,

Thank you for reaching out to us today !

I ’ m so very sorry to hear that you didn &apos;t receive your package as scheduled ! I can certainly understand your frustration . I &apos;m a Freshly customer as well , and I &apos;m very dependent on getting those weekly meals ! While incidents such as these are out of the norm , they can sometimes happen . I have reported this issue to our Delivery Specialist for further investigation into the cause of this delay . I &apos;m afraid we wouldn &apos;t be able to switch to a different carrier .

To further express my apologies , I have issued two separate in-house credits in the amount of $ 49.99 for the inconvenience . Those credits will automatically apply to your next charges . So your next two orders will be at no cost to you .

Please be aware that those meals are considered spoiled at this point and will need to be disposed of . I certainly don &apos;t want you to risk getting sick by eating any !

Once again , my sincere apologies Cheri , and if you should need anything going forward , I &apos;m always happy to help !

Thank you for reaching out to us !

Each of our meals are single servings that are intended for one person . We design our meals to be satisfying , so that you will not go hunting for another snack later !

We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help you manage a subscription if you decide you &apos;d like to give us a try :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


I hope this helps , Maureen , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

Customer Care SpecialistTeam Freshly ;


Glad to SEE that you are updating the packing . Thanks for that . There is one thing that is evident from your existing packaging design that I hope you address . THAT SIZE OF THE TEXT FOR COOKING INSTRUCTIONS . ( CAPS INTENDED ) . Essentially your current packaging fails &quot; the Mom test &quot; ! Yah that &apos;s right - give it to your Mom and ask her to read it ! She can &apos;t without getting a pair of reading glasses . Fix this problem dear millennials . You have plenty of white space in your cooking directions on the packaging . Selectively increase the font size on the most critical information - like cook times - OK ?


Thanks
Will SchreiberHi Will ,

Thank you for reaching out to us ! I am so sorry for any inconvenience regarding the size of the text on our packaging , and I will certainly forward this over to our Quality Assurance team for further review !

We definitely do not intend to inconvenience our customers in anyway , and are always looking for ways to improve our service . Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback . We really appreciate this !

Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns , Will . I &apos;m happy to help !


Have a great day !



Fresh wishes ,

We &apos;re so sorry your delivery was delayed .
A note about your delivery

Hello ,

We &apos;ve been advised by our delivery partner that your order didn ’ t arrive yesterday as scheduled . This is definitely not the type of experience we want for our customers .

Because of this delay , your meals will have been unrefrigerated for an amount of time that makes them unsafe to eat . As a result , we have asked the carrier to discard your package , although there &apos;s a chance it will still arrive . If this happens , please dispose of the meals without eating them . Your health is our top priority and we can no longer guarantee the freshness of your order , even if the meals still feel cold .

Please accept our sincere apologies — it &apos;s extremely frustrating to expect to get your meals and then have to make a new plan . Due to this , we &apos;ve given you a 100 % refund for your order ( this should appear in your bank account within five business days ) . Additionally , we &apos;ve added a 50 % off in-store credit to your subscription ; this will be valid for six months from now and will automatically apply the next time you &apos;re charged for an order .

Again , we &apos;re so sorry about this and truly appreciate your patience !

Sincerely ,
The Freshly Team

Thank you for reaching out to us !

I do apologize , but this offer would not be able to be redeemed moving into the next year . The offer this is based off of is expiring at the end of this year . We may have a similar offer starting , or other offers at the time . Feel free to reach out to us when you &apos;d like , and we can see if we have any offers available ! It would be no problem to get you a promotion code if we have any . These offers are not location restricted .

Customer Service SpecialistHello Chelsea ,

Thank you for getting back to me !

This offer is based off an existing offer that we have currently where customers can sign up for two weeks of $ 20 off an order . The link that was sent is a temporary link that expires , but you can always sign up for the offer it &apos;s based off of . If you wanted to sign up now to reserve your spot in January for an order , that &apos;s perfectly ok ! You would be able to pick your order for January , be charged now at the discounted rate , and still have a second order for the discount price .

That is if you sign up in this year . The offer is ending this year for new use , and different offer may take it &apos;s place in January . It may be the same monetary amount , or it could less or more . The codes these offers are attached to do expire though , and my marketing team is working at figuring out what offers we &apos;d like to have in the future . This offer was sent to all potential customers on the East Coast , as we &apos;re opening our new kitchen there , to service all 48 Continental United States .

If you have any other questions or concerns , please do let me know !

Thank you , and have a great day Chelsea !

Thank you for reaching out to us !

I &apos;m so sorry to hear that ! It sounds like there was an accident with packing your order , and it wasn &apos;t packed correctly . We do pack these orders by hand , so it &apos;s possible for mistakes to occur . We &apos;ll be investigating this to figure out what might have happened , to hopefully prevent that in the future !

I &apos;ve also issued you an in-store credit of $ 18 , to come off your next order with us . This is an automatic , one-time use credit that expires after six months if not used .

Since you &apos;re a new customer with us , I just wanted to let you know we are a weekly and automatic subscription service . This means that you will automatically be charged for and then delivered meals on a weekly basis . Of course , there is no contract or commitment . You are able to skip your orders or cancel your service as you need . You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Friday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Saturday , before 2 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :

How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?


How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?


How do I skip a week ?

Customer Service SpecialistI ’ d like to pre pay for several meals as a gift and not need to pause or cancel afterward . Is that possible ? Hello Uofiee ,

Thank you for reaching out !

I am afraid we currently do not offer gift cards , we are hoping to release our gifting program very soon ! you can order a subscription for someone else using your information and set the gift recipient ’ s address as the shipping address on the subscription . This would ensure that you are charged for the subscription , but that the gift recipient is the one who gets the meals .

To set up a menu for the first delivery , you &apos;ll want to get the recipients list of desired meals ( or select meals for them , ) then place the order ! We don &apos;t have trial options , so if you want to gift one week only you &apos;ll just need to cancel the subscription after the first order has been shipped . If you &apos;re ordering more than one week , you could share the login details with the recipient so they can make changes to their future orders ! The deadline to cancel or edit meals prior to the second order being charged will also be listed in your Welcome Email !

I hope this helps Uofiee , and if you have any further questions or concerns don &apos;t hesitate to reach out !

If your order arrives today , it &apos;s safe to enjoy your meals as normal . Our packaging is designed to withstand two days in transit , plus 12 hours on your doorstep . Today is the second day of transit .

Thank you for taking the time to check in , and I &apos;m glad to hear the meals arrived there !

I do see that the order was initially meant to arrive yesterday . To apologize for the delay , I will make sure a $ 10 in-store credit is added to your subscription ; this will be valid for up to 6 months from now and will apply the next time you are due to be charged for an order . You won &apos;t have to do anything further there to make use of it .

Thank you very again for your time and patience , Arleen , and please let me know if there &apos;s anything more I can lend a hand with here !

Customer Care SpecialistHello , if I switch my account to 12 meals per week , that won ’ t take effect until after January 6th ? Just curious.Hello Marc ,

Thanks for reaching out to us ! I reviewed your subscription and you can actually change meal plans as early as the week of Dec. 21st , just make sure to unskip it first . Please see screenshot below .

As long as you update your orders ( including meal plan ) by your deadline , Sunday , before 5 p.m . PT , based on a Friday delivery day , you should be fine .



​


I can also update this for you so just let me know ! For your convenience , here are the instructions on how to change your meal plan : How do I change the number of meals in my plan ?

If you &apos;re making an update for all orders going forward ( as opposed to just 1 weekly order or so ) , note that this is a 2-step process , first , via Subscription Settings ( for future orders beyond 3 weeks or beyond Jan. 4th ) and , second , via the Meal Planner , for future orders within the next 3 weeks or before &amp; amp ; including Jan. 4th ) .

On a side note , there is no Dec. 28th order scheduled due to the holiday week having limited production ( we &apos;re giving our production folks time off to spend with their family ) . However , for now , we still have Monday , Dec. 24th as an alternate date . If you don &apos;t want an order for this week , you don &apos;t need to do anything further , there is nothing scheduled , however , if you want food that week and Dec. 24th works for you , please make the change in your Meal Planner ( or let me know ) .

If there &apos;s anything else that I can help you with , Marc , please let me know !

( 06 : 02 : 13 PM ) Jacki : Is there an option for delivery other that Thursday ? I received my first order late yesterday and they 6 meals expire 4 days later on the 17th . My intention was to use these for during the week when I don &apos;t have time to cook . Between the delivery date and the expiration date that isn &apos;t going to be feasible .

( 06 : 02 : 25 PM ) Eric : Thanks for reaching out to Freshly !

( 06 : 02 : 55 PM ) Eric : I do apologize for the inconvenience ! I can certainly see what other dates we have available .

( 06 : 03 : 45 PM ) Eric : One thing to note is that since we don &apos;t use chemical or artificial preservatives , our meal tend to last about 4 to 5 days in your fridge . I still suggest going off of the Use By Date or even freezing them to make them last longer .

( 06 : 03 : 47 PM ) Eric : Could you please verify the phone number associated with the subscription ?

( 06 : 11 : 05 PM ) Eric : You can change that within Subscription Settings .

( 06 : 11 : 06 PM ) Jacki : I &apos;ve done that but even though you &apos;re saying there is a Wednesday the week of the 13th I &apos;m not seeing it on the calendar or able to change my order .

( 06 : 11 : 43 PM ) Jacki : The circles still only show Thrusday

( 06 : 11 : 45 PM ) Eric : There should be a little drop down to select Wednesday .

( 06 : 04 : 49 PM ) ayse : Hello- I &apos;d like to skip the 19th delivery , but would love to get as close to the 26th as possible. can you deliver on the 27th ?

( 06 : 05 : 01 PM ) Samantha : Hello Ayse !

( 06 : 05 : 05 PM ) Samantha : One moment while I pull up your subscription to look into this for you .

( 06 : 06 : 23 PM ) Samantha : I do see that you have already skipped the December 19th order , however , we are not able to deliver in your area for the next two weeks due to Christmas and New Years . We want to make sure our employees have time to spend with their families , as does the carrier , so we are unable to ship meals and ensure that they arrive fresh and safe to eat .

( 06 : 06 : 52 PM ) Samantha : The next planned order is currently scheduled for January 9th .

( 06 : 07 : 02 PM ) ayse : i see ! that makes sense

( 06 : 07 : 14 PM ) Samantha : I do apologize for any inconvenience that may cause .

( 06 : 07 : 46 PM ) ayse : No worries ! just planning vacations for the same reasons as above. can i freeze what i have ?

( 06 : 07 : 52 PM ) Samantha : Of course !

( 06 : 08 : 04 PM ) Samantha : You may , if needed , freeze meals to make them last longer - in which case , when it comes time to heat the meals , simply microwave for one to two minutes from the frozen state prior to following the printed heating instructions . You would not thaw out the meal .

( 06 : 08 : 21 PM ) ayse : yay ! thanks ! thats all I need ! !

( 06 : 08 : 36 PM ) Samantha : You &apos;re very welcome , Ayse .

( 06 : 28 : 25 PM ) Ruby Nguyen : Hello , I changed my delivery date to yesterday instead of my regular Friday deliveries because I ’ m going out of town this afternoon for the weekend and I won ’ t be able to put my meals in the refrigerator . They didn ’ t deliver and I received an email this morning with the delay but I would like a full refund instead and not have them delivered anymore .

( 06 : 28 : 45 PM ) Samantha : Hello Ruby !

( 06 : 28 : 50 PM ) Samantha : One moment while I pull up your subscription to look into this for you .

( 06 : 30 : 28 PM ) Ruby Nguyen : This is probably the 4th or 5th time my meals have not been delivered on time and it ’ s extremely frustrating .

( 06 : 31 : 15 PM ) Samantha : I am so very sorry about this . Delivery delays are never something that we expect to happen , however with the amount of package due to the holiday season , sometimes situations out of our control can cause this to happen .

( 06 : 32 : 30 PM ) Samantha : The meals are currently out for delivery and should be arriving to you shortly . We may not be able to get this package stopped due to this , but we can try for you since you will not be home .

( 06 : 32 : 34 PM ) Samantha : Please give me one more moment to work on this .

( 06 : 32 : 40 PM ) Ruby Nguyen : I understand that but they ’ re should be more of an effort to notify customers that same delivery day of the delay instead of the next day because I ’ m like literally waiting for them

( 06 : 32 : 53 PM ) Ruby Nguyen : Sometimes I don ’ t even get an email

( 06 : 33 : 01 PM ) Ruby Nguyen : And I ’ ve been a customer since June

( 06 : 33 : 14 PM ) Ruby Nguyen : I didn ’ t expect this to happen so frequently

( 06 : 33 : 16 PM ) Samantha : We always try to reach out as soon as we can , however , we have to wait from notice from the carrier regarding delays as well . I apologize that we could not let you know about this sooner .

( 06 : 35 : 15 PM ) Samantha : I have let our delivery specialist know that you will not be home to accept the meals today , and we will do everything we can to have this package stopped . To further express my apologies , I have issued a full refund in the amount of $ 89.99 to cover the cost of the meals this week . Refunds may take 3-5 business days to completely process , however this can vary depending on your bank . I &apos;ve also applied a 50 % in-house credit in the amount of $ 45 for the inconvenience . This credit will be automatically applied to your next charge with us and will be available for a one time use within the next 6 months .

( 06 : 35 : 43 PM ) Ruby Nguyen : Thank you I appreciate it

( 06 : 36 : 02 PM ) Samantha : You &apos;re very welcome , Ruby .

( 06 : 36 : 09 PM ) Samantha : At this time , your next order is planned for January 4th .

( 06 : 36 : 20 PM ) MICHELLE LINDBERG : sounds good. what happened to the pork chops ?

( 06 : 36 : 28 PM ) Marco : Here is our description for the Slow-Cooked Pork : This paleo-friendly meal features juicy shredded pork ( high in protein and a good source of iron ! ) topped with a deliciously savory , dairy-free gravy made with fragrant herbs , rosemary and thyme . It ’ s served over roasted carrots tossed in garlic-parsley oil . Our second side features kale , the vitamin-heavy superveg and one of our favorite leafy greens , cooked with nitrate- and sugar-free bacon and fire-roasted tomatoes . Bonus : Double the veggie sides means this meal is high in fiber . Our chefs recommend a squeeze of lemon on your kale and a sprinkle of freshly cracked pepper over the whole meal .

( 06 : 37 : 14 PM ) Marco : We definitely try to update our menus on a weekly basis and usually replace less popular meals . I can however , put in feedback in an attempt to bring it back on your behalf !

( 06 : 37 : 52 PM ) MICHELLE LINDBERG : yeah. get rid of the southwest chicken bowl and bring back the pork chops : )

( 06 : 38 : 04 PM ) Marco : Okay , definitely I will put in the feedback !

( 06 : 52 : 17 PM ) Eric : We work with the carrier to see where it is that we are having issues and attempt to remedy it , but I certainly understand this process has been frustrating for you .

( 06 : 53 : 23 PM ) Eric : I do see that your last delivery was delivered a day late , but was still good . Hopefully your next shipment arrives on time . Once again I do apologize for this .

( 06 : 54 : 32 PM ) Xan West : i understand that delieveries cannot always be on time. however , my complaint is with constantly getting $ 10 credit . This does not feel like it identifies how inconvienent these delays are .

( 06 : 55 : 00 PM ) Eric : That is the standard credit with give for delays , but I can see what else I can do for you .

( 06 : 55 : 58 PM ) Xan West : yes , and I think you should rethink that policy. i &apos;m tired of spending my personal time getting fair compensation for poor service .

( 06 : 56 : 47 PM ) Eric : I will certainly pass this on for you . I have increased the credit to $ 20 instead of $ 10 .

( 03 : 13 : 17 PM ) Eric Bates : is there anyway packages can be delivered to my apartment door ?

( 03 : 13 : 50 PM ) Adam : We can make a request , but if your complex has a policy to leave them at one location , I cannot change that .

( 03 : 14 : 43 PM ) Eric Bates : I dont think there &apos;s a policy because i have gotten amazon packages to my apartment door but never from Freshly

( 03 : 15 : 17 PM ) Eric Bates : I used to think it might because of the heat during the summer . But being in the middle of winter , I won &apos;t mind having them sit outside until I can get home

( 07 : 06 : 34 PM ) Martin : Thank you for reaching out to us !

( 07 : 06 : 48 PM ) Martin : Typically , each meal has a refrigerated shelf-life of 3-5 days .

( 07 : 07 : 10 PM ) Martin : You are certainly able to freeze any meals before their use-by date , so that they can be good for an additional 2 weeks .

( 07 : 07 : 27 PM ) Martin : When ready to enjoy , you simply need to add a couple of minutes to the heating time and reheat from frozen , without thawing . We recommend confirming that the food is reheated to 165 degrees , the same as reheating from fresh !

( 07 : 07 : 48 PM ) Christy : Oh that ’ s great . Do the menu selections change each week and when do I place the next order ?

( 07 : 08 : 39 PM ) Martin : Definitely !

( 07 : 08 : 51 PM ) Martin : Typically , we add and remove a meal from our menu every week .

( 07 : 09 : 03 PM ) Martin : This is largely based on customer feedback and the ratings that meals receive online .

( 07 : 09 : 36 PM ) Christy : So I just log into my account and order for the next delivery ?

( 07 : 09 : 38 PM ) Martin : Your next delivery is scheduled for Saturday , January 05 .

( 07 : 10 : 02 PM ) Martin : Right , you would just need to log into your Meal Planner before your weekly deadline and make any changes to that delivery .

( 07 : 10 : 10 PM ) Martin : As a friendly reminder , we are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week !

( 07 : 10 : 24 PM ) Martin : Monday by 2PM PT would be your weekly deadline for making updates or skipping a delivery , since your deliveries are on Saturday .

( 07 : 11 : 39 PM ) Christy : Thank you I will go there now ! ! Have a Happy New Year !

( 07 : 11 : 54 PM ) Martin : My pleasure , Christy !

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Thank you for the offer . The other issue in all honesty , was I don ’ t find the meals very good . While the meals hit the right price point I don ’ t find the flavor very good . I have used Munchery since they started and find the flavors ( and variety ) far superior . For example , the penne bolognese had no flavor to it whatsoever .

Yes , Munchery costs more but selection and taste are worth it .


Thanks again
Renee&apos;

Hello Renee !

I hope you ’ re having a great week ! I saw you canceled your subscription recently because you wanted more meal variety … I ’ m so sorry to hear this !

Since you &apos;ve been gone , we ’ ve added new meals to the menu , like Butternut Squash Risotto , Sausage Baked Penne , and Lebanese-Style Beef Meatballs .

Also , you need not receive meals every single week , but , instead , can skip weeks here and there and come back after we &apos;ve added some new , yummy meals to our menu ! I &apos;d be happy to help arrange this for you , should you be interested .

If you &apos;d like to give us a try again , I &apos;d like to offer you $ 10 off your next order . Just reactivate your subscription by clicking here , go to &quot; Subscription Settings &quot; , and add the code freshconnect389453 to your subscription ! The code will be active through January 7th .


And , of course , if you have any questions at all , I ’ d be more than happy to chat over email , text , or hop on a call ... whatever works for you !

( 07 : 33 : 11 PM ) Eric : Looks like January 22nd is still set as your first delivery date .

( 07 : 33 : 57 PM ) Jaime Moskowitz : Ok good , any chance I can have it delivered on that Sunday instead ? The 20th

( 07 : 34 : 24 PM ) Eric : Unfortunately , The 22nd is the soonest . I do apologize !

( 07 : 34 : 32 PM ) Jaime Moskowitz : Ok that ’ s fine thanks

( 07 : 34 : 43 PM ) Eric : Is there anything else I can assist you with ?

( 07 : 35 : 01 PM ) Jaime Moskowitz : How do I skip the week after that ?

( 07 : 35 : 43 PM ) Eric : It hasn &apos;t shown up yet in the Meal Planner so we can &apos;t skip it , but you should see it pop up in a week or two in your meal planner .

( 07 : 36 : 16 PM ) Jaime Moskowitz : And how long do the meals last before you have to heat them up and eat them ? Like how long can I store it in my fridge

( 07 : 37 : 15 PM ) Eric : Since we don &apos;t use chemical or artificial preservatives , our meals last about 4 to 5 days in your fridge . I would still recommend going off of the Use By Dates on the back of each meal .

( 07 : 37 : 28 PM ) Eric : You may , if needed , freeze meals to make them last longer - in which case , when it comes time to heat the meals , simply microwave for one to two minutes from the frozen state prior to following the printed heating instructions .

( 07 : 37 : 52 PM ) Jaime Moskowitz : Oh ok that ’ s good that you can freeze them

Thank you

( 07 : 38 : 13 PM ) Eric : You &apos;re very welcome !

Customer Service LeadJason , I have received 2 orders now from Freshly , both delivered in the afternoon of the 3rd shipping day . I received emails from Freshly both times stating there might be a delay in receiving my order . Those emails also advised me to discard the meals after a certain day and time . So , i have yet to receive a 1st order to see how I like this service . Please tell me the status of any future orders and what to do about getting these shipments in a timely manner . Thank you ! !

( 04 : 48 : 38 AM ) Taylor L. : We want to ensure the best variety in tastiness for our customers , so we add one new meal ( sometimes two ! ) to our menu almost every week . This would either involve adding in a completely new meal or revamping a pre-existing meal to make it even more delicious .

Dear Freshly team ,


Thank you for your service .


My first 4 meals were great except the delivery date was not met .


Now , my second delivery is supposed to be today ( 12 / 29 / 18 ) . Yesterday I received the email which said that the meals had been shipped like the last time . What happened last time was even though the shipping was made seemingly on time , yet the delivery was not .


Unfortunately , it looks like the tracking record shows that it is arriving NEXT YEAR , 1 / 2 / 19 , instead of today as the yesterday &apos;s email said . If this is true , I have to admit my great disappointment since the delivery promise is not reliable yet again , and I cannot plan my meal plan throughout the week , which is whole part of paying this service .


I was going to continue , but I am thinking twice .


As a new customer , I am sharing my feedback before I make a decision , though I did not have to do this .
I thought you might want to hear from a customer .


Merry Christmas .


Toshio

115 E. 23rd St. , 7th Floor , New York , NY 10010Hello Toshio ,

I ’ m so very sorry to hear that you didn &apos;t receive your package as scheduled , especially since this is not the first time this has happened ! I can certainly understand your frustration . I &apos;m a Freshly customer as well , and I &apos;m very dependent on getting those weekly meals ! While incidents such as these are out of the norm , they can sometimes happen . I have reported this issue to our Delivery Specialist for further investigation into the cause of this delay . I do know that due to the holiday season , the carriers have a higher volume of packages to deliver , so that might be the cause of this delay .

To further express my apologies , I have issued a full refund in the amount of $ 39.99 to cover the cost of the meals you didn &apos;t receive , and you should see those funds post to your account within 3-5 business days . I &apos;ve also applied an in-house credit in the amount of $ 20.00 for the inconvenience . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically apply toward your next charged order . I have also placed an in-house credit of $ 10.00 to make up for the credit used towards this order .

Please be aware that those meals are considered spoiled at this point and will need to be disposed of . I &apos;ve made a request for the carrier to dispose of the package for you . I certainly don &apos;t want you to risk getting sick by eating any !

Just as a friendly reminder , we are a weekly based subscription service . This means you &apos;ll have an automatic charge and shipment of meals each week . Your weekly deadline to make any changes to your Saturday orders is every Monday before 2pm PT . Your deadline for your Wednesday orders is every Friday by 2pm PT .

Once again , my sincere apologies Toshio , and if you should need anything going forward , I &apos;m always happy to help !

( 05 : 33 : 00 PM ) Taylor : A signature will be required at a business location . I do apologize , but we don &apos;t have a way to do away with that to a business address at this time .

( 05 : 34 : 08 PM ) Oliver Lorenzo : Ok , but if signature is required , am I going to be notified by phone or text of my meals arrival ?

( 05 : 35 : 02 PM ) Oliver Lorenzo : By the driver or the app

( 05 : 35 : 05 PM ) Taylor : We send you a link with the tracking information once the meals are ready to ship , but the drivers are typically unable to call due to volume and the fact that they often operate off of their personal phones since we work with third party carriers .

( 05 : 36 : 22 PM ) Taylor : You can track the package and expect it to arrive within the 8 am - 9 pm window , but we don &apos;t have a way at this time to request or guarantee a specific delivery time due to working with third party carriers , such as FedEx and Ontrac . You &apos;re welcome to contact them directly to see if they &apos;re able to better accommodate that request directly , but on the Freshly end , they delivery as explained above .

( 05 : 38 : 19 PM ) Taylor : Please let me know if I can assist you with anything further ! I &apos;d also appreciate your taking our quick survey about your experience once the chat is over .

( 05 : 14 : 56 PM ) Christine Rodriguez : I just noticed that there was a coupon through Ebates that I forgot to add onto the promotion . Is there a way to get that . I noticed that there was a 7.50 credit

( 05 : 15 : 03 PM ) * * * Adam joined the chat * * *

( 05 : 15 : 08 PM ) Adam : Hi Christine !

( 05 : 15 : 31 PM ) Adam : I can help you with that !

( 05 : 15 : 39 PM ) Adam : Do you know what the promo code was ?

( 05 : 15 : 55 PM ) Christine Rodriguez : LAUNCH15

( 05 : 16 : 39 PM ) Adam : One moment while I pull up your subscription to look into this for you !

( 05 : 17 : 05 PM ) Christine Rodriguez : Great thanks !

( 05 : 18 : 13 PM ) Adam : Now I do see that you took advantage of the $ 40 off promo

( 05 : 18 : 33 PM ) Christine Rodriguez : Yes .

( 05 : 18 : 50 PM ) Christine Rodriguez : But with the promo they were giving an additional 7.50

( 05 : 20 : 00 PM ) Adam : One moment while I look into that promo code for you !

( 05 : 20 : 11 PM ) Adam : Sorry for the delay !

( 05 : 20 : 51 PM ) Adam : While I look into that , as an FYI , we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged ) meals on a weekly basis .

In your subscription , you are able to plan out your menus for up to three weeks in advance .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Monday , any changes to your weekly order , or if you decide to skip the week , would need to be made by Wednesday , prior to 2 pm PT .

( 05 : 23 : 19 PM ) Adam : So I have some information ! That promo code is good for $ 15 off for four weeks . You can apply that after the initial two week promo you signed up with !

( 05 : 24 : 22 PM ) Adam : Are you still there , Christine ?

( 05 : 24 : 33 PM ) Christine Rodriguez : Yes

( 05 : 25 : 14 PM ) Adam : I know I gave you a lot of information , but does that make sense ?

( 05 : 26 : 29 PM ) Christine Rodriguez : My only question is if they are charging me now for Jan 21 meals does that mean the next payment would be after Jan 21 ?

( 05 : 27 : 14 PM ) Adam : You won &apos;t be charged again until the next order . As we get closer to the 21st you will see the additional weeks open up .

( 05 : 27 : 35 PM ) Adam : Just be sure to make any changes or skip the week prior to your Wednesday deadline .

( 05 : 28 : 02 PM ) Adam : So the 23rd is when you would be charged again .

( 05 : 28 : 25 PM ) Christine Rodriguez : ok got it ... so when would I pick meals for the following week ?

( 05 : 28 : 53 PM ) Adam : Prior to the Wednesday deadline . Normally you will see up to three weeks in advance .

( 05 : 28 : 59 PM ) Adam : Do you use an iPhone ?

( 05 : 29 : 18 PM ) Christine Rodriguez : Yes . I downloaded the app

( 05 : 29 : 55 PM ) Adam : Perfect ! It will remind you when you need to make your changes .

( 05 : 32 : 08 PM ) Adam : Is there anything else I can assist you with ?

( 05 : 32 : 29 PM ) Christine Rodriguez : no . Were you able to fix the issue with the cash back ?

( 05 : 32 : 41 PM ) Adam : On the promotion ?

( 05 : 32 : 54 PM ) Christine Rodriguez : Yes

( 05 : 33 : 23 PM ) Adam : So that LAUNCH15 is a separate promotion . You can use that after the two weeks you signed up with .

( 05 : 33 : 33 PM ) Adam : It will take off $ 15 for four weeks .

( 05 : 33 : 37 PM ) Christine Rodriguez : ok thanks !

( 05 : 16 : 27 PM ) Adam : I do apologize for any confusion . We did have it in the Meal Planner three weeks in advance .

( 05 : 16 : 38 PM ) shawna : the company has to understand that entire errand trips change when a whole week &apos;s worth of meals are suddenly not going to be provided

( 05 : 17 : 03 PM ) Adam : Due to the holidays and limited availability of the carriers , this has caused the delay .

( 05 : 17 : 14 PM ) Adam : I certainly do apologize !

( 05 : 17 : 21 PM ) shawna : yeah , three weeks in advance , when people are traveling / prepping for the holidays

( 05 : 17 : 50 PM ) Adam : I can certainly share the feedback to incorporate an email in the future !

( 05 : 18 : 05 PM ) shawna : i took the time to pause certain deliveries due to my own travels , far enough in advance that these notifications weren &apos;t even there

( 05 : 18 : 21 PM ) shawna : you realize that &apos;s a really dead end response for a customer

( 05 : 18 : 45 PM ) Adam : I am sincerely sorry , Shawna !

Dear Leonard ,

We &apos;ve been advised by our delivery partner that your order may not have reached you yesterday as planned . Due to technical issues on their end , we don &apos;t currently have accurate tracking info .

If your meals arrive today , they will have been unrefrigerated for an amount of time that makes them unsafe to eat .

Rest assured you &apos;ll be fully compensated for your order if this occurs .

Are you still waiting for your meals ?

If so , please reply to this email letting us know you have not received your meals yet .

115 E. 23rd St. , 7th Floor , New York , NY 10010Hello Leonard ,

I ’ m so very sorry to hear that you didn &apos;t receive your package as scheduled ! I can certainly understand your frustration . I &apos;m a Freshly customer as well , and I &apos;m very dependent on getting those weekly meals ! While incidents such as these are out of the norm , they can sometimes happen . I have reported this issue to our Delivery Specialist for further investigation into the cause of this delay .

To further express my apologies , I have issued a full refund in the amount of $ 59.99 to cover the cost of the meals you didn &apos;t receive , and you should see those funds post to your account within 3-5 business days . I &apos;ve also applied an in-house credit in the amount of $ 20.00 for the inconvenience . That credit will automatically apply to your next charge .

Please be aware that those meals are considered spoiled at this point and will need to be disposed of . I certainly don &apos;t want you to risk getting sick by eating any !

Once again , my sincere apologies Leonard , and if you should need anything going forward , I &apos;m always happy to help !

Thanks for contacting Freshly ! My name is AJ , and I &apos;m so happy to tell you about our service today .

A little about Freshly , we were started in Tucson , Arizona and now our headquarters is in New York City . Currently , all of our meals are prepared at our facility in Phoenix , Arizona and we &apos;re excited to announce that we &apos;re opening up another facility in Savage , Maryland in early 2019 !

Our first available delivery date for West Bloomfield Township , MI is Friday , January 11 , 2019 .

We are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

What should I know before I order ?


What am I committing to with a subscription ?



How often am I charged for my meals ?




Please let me know if you have any questions , Jawad , thank you for considering Freshly for your meals !

We &apos;re so sorry your delivery was delayed . A note about your delivery

Dear Tasha ,

We &apos;ve been advised by our delivery partner that your order didn ’ t arrive yesterday as scheduled . This is definitely not the type of experience we want for our customers .

The good news is that your meals should arrive today and are still fresh . ( Our packaging is designed to withstand two days in transit , plus 12 hours on your doorstep , and today is the second day of transit . )

Please accept our apologies — it &apos;s extremely frustrating to expect to get your meals and then have to make a new plan . As a thanks for your patience and understanding , we ’ ve added a $ 10 in-store credit to your subscription ; this will be valid for six months from now and will automatically apply the next time you &apos;re charged for an order .

Again , we &apos;re so sorry about this ! If you have any questions at all , you can reach our Delivery Team using the contact icons below .

Thanks so much for your follow up !

I &apos;m terribly sorry to hear that you didn &apos;t receive your December 13th order as expected , especially since this isn &apos;t your first experience with a delay ! I &apos;m so very sorry for the inconvenience and the frustrations involved , as I know many customers depend on their Freshly meals and we always aim to ensure the timeliness of our deliveries ! I can assure you the matter has been reported with urgency for further investigation , as we definitely want to be sure we &apos;re doing all we can to try to prevent this from happening again !

With the holiday season , our carriers have seen a higher volume of packages then anticipated and the winter weather has such as ice , snow , and sleet have caused delays as well . I appreciate your patience as we get through the holiday season and winter weather .

Even though your meals have been delayed , as you are in an area closer to our kitchen , they &apos;ll still have time to arrive for you to be able to enjoy them ! We design our packages to withstand two full days of shipment , plus twelve hours at your doorstep - today is the 2nd transit day so please hang tight !

I can confirm that we &apos;ve issued a $ 10 in house credit for the inconvenience , but since I understand this isn &apos;t your first experience with a delay , I certainly don &apos;t mind issuing and additional $ 20 for the inconvenience . This makes a total 50 % credit balance in the amount of $ 30 that &apos;ll remain valid for up to 6 months and should auto apply to the total of your next open order .

Again , my sincerest apologies for the trouble , Tasha ! If there &apos;s anything else I can further assist with today , please let me know !

Customer Care SpecialistI was just wondering if you have a low carb diabetic friendly menu

Thanks

Jessica Dile

Sent from my iPhoneHello Jessica ,

Thank you for reaching out today ! My name is AJ , and I &apos;ll be happy to help .

As a little background , we create our menu around high-quality proteins , healthy fats , and complex carbs that come from nutrient-dense veggies , whole grains , and natural sweeteners .

We know that our customers have a wide range of preferences when it comes to carb content so we aim to deliver a wide range of options . Our meals range from about 15 grams of carbs ( and as low as 11 net carbs , or total carbs minus fiber content ) , up to about 60 grams in some of our whole-grain dishes . Some of our meals have a badge indicating that they are 35 grams of carbs or less so that you can easily find them while choosing meals on our menu .

Because “ low carb ” does not have one standard FDA definition , goals for eating “ low carb ” vary . We recently launched a sort feature in the top righthand corner of the &quot; Choose Meals &quot; page so you can sort by carbs , from lowest to highest .

How to Sort Nutritional Components

This tool is useful if you have a specific goal in mind . However , if you have any pre-existing medical conditions , we do recommend that you work with your doctor or nutritionist to determine what meals are right for you .

Here &apos;s our current menu so you can get an idea of what we offer ; https : / / www.freshly.com / on-the-menu

We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Megan :

Thanks for the message . I do have a quick question : can I delay delivery of an order ? I am interested in the deal and I want to place an order , but my wife and I will be out of town next week for 5 days to visit family over the holiday . The website offered delivery on the 21 , but then the food would have to be immediately frozen or thrown away after our trip . So , in sum , can I request that delivery begin at a later date ? Thank you .

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! I have a friend who is having surgery and I wanted to send her a few meals , but not a subscription . Can I do this ?

Julie HowerHello Julie ,

Thank you for reaching out to us !

Well you &apos;re certainly able to gift our service to someone , but I do apologize we only offer our service as a subscription . You can either create the subscription for them , or they can create and manage it for themselves . By default we &apos;re a weekly and automatic subscription service , but you can of course cancel at any time . I &apos;ve included a link below that explains how to gift our service !

Can I order Freshly as a gift for someone ?

If you have any other questions or concerns , please do let me know !

Thank you , and have a great day Julie !

Customer Service SpecialistIs this a monthly membership ?

Or can you order meals whenever ?

Sent from my iPhoneHello ,

Thank you so much for reaching out to us , and for your interest in Freshly !

We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help you manage a subscription if you decide you &apos;d like to give us a try :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


I hope this helps , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

( 07 : 14 : 00 PM ) Kasandra : As of right now , you can order a subscription for someone else using your information and set the gift recipient ’ s address as the shipping address on the subscription . This would ensure that you are charged for the subscription , but that the gift recipient is the one who gets the meals .

( 07 : 15 : 06 PM ) Thais Voet : I understand . Does the a subscription get canceled after a certain period of time or should I just monitor it ?

( 07 : 15 : 40 PM ) Kasandra : It will only be canceled if you contact us and have us do it , or you go on the website and do it yourself , so you will need to monitor it .

( 07 : 15 : 55 PM ) Kasandra : Don &apos;t forget that the subscription can be canceled at any time !

I get 6 meals , 1 for each day of the following week this shipment only gave 3 days 12 / 8 , 12 / 9 &amp; amp ; 12 / 10 to eat 6 meals and 3 were spoiled before I can update eat them , very disappointed , I love these meals ! I will be gone for the holidays so I skipped 2 weeks and now the week I wanted to start up again is not an option ... January 4th . Is it better if I choose a different day of the week , like Monday ? ..

( 07 : 33 : 13 PM ) * * * Samantha joined the chat * * *

( 07 : 33 : 23 PM ) Samantha : Hello Pamela !

( 07 : 33 : 27 PM ) Samantha : I am so very sorry to hear this !

( 07 : 33 : 38 PM ) Samantha : The meals that we send to customers have a use-by date of about 4 days after they are delivered - although the shelf life could vary slightly in some cases . You can check the “ use by ” date on a meal ’ s cardboard sleeve for more specifics regarding that meal itself . We do the best we can to ensure the freshness of our meals by packaging them securely and ensuring they are nice and cool during the shipping process .

( 07 : 33 : 40 PM ) Samantha : Please bear in mind that our meals are literally fresh - meaning that we cook them and then ship them right to you - so , as would be the case when you cook food for yourself , the freshness factor inherently puts restrictions on the shelf life . We also don &apos;t add artificial or chemical preservatives to our meals , because we strive to be all-natural in all aspects of our food preparation .

( 07 : 35 : 40 PM ) Samantha : Regarding the available delivery days during the holidays , we are unable to ship out meals during the week of Christmas or New Years . This is because we want to make sure to give our employees time with their families , and so does the carrier . We will be unable to prepare and ship meals in time for them to arrive fresh and safe to eat during those two weeks .

( 07 : 37 : 06 PM ) Pamela Syverson : That is why I love them , have been doing this for a while and this is the 1st time ever this has happened ! Was surprised that 3 of them spoiled ...

( 07 : 37 : 48 PM ) Samantha : I do apologize about that , Pamela . Because the meals had expired , this would be why you found them in that state . You can freeze the meals before the use-by date to make them last longer , if need be .

( 07 : 38 : 42 PM ) Pamela Syverson : Didn ’ t know I could freeze them , good to know .

( 07 : 39 : 01 PM ) Samantha : When it comes time to heat the meals , simply microwave for one to two minutes from the frozen state prior to following the printed heating instructions . You would not thaw out the meal first .

( 07 : 39 : 35 PM ) Pamela Syverson : Ok

( 07 : 40 : 10 PM ) Samantha : As a courtesy , what I can do for you is apply an in-store credit in the amount of $ 30 to cover the cost of the meals you were unable to enjoy . This credit will be automatically applied to your next charge with us and will be available for a one time use within the next 6 months .

( 07 : 41 : 07 PM ) Pamela Syverson : Ohhh , thank you so much ! Really appreciate that !

( 07 : 41 : 13 PM ) Samantha : You &apos;re very welcome , Pamela .

However , I just checked and we do have 4 spots open for delivery on Thursday , December 20th . I could cancel your subscription and you can sign up on our 12-Meal Plan .

( 07 : 50 : 00 PM ) Susie : Great

( 07 : 50 : 08 PM ) AJ : 😃

( 07 : 50 : 44 PM ) AJ : A little about Freshly , we were started in Tucson , Arizona and now our headquarters is in New York City . Currently , all of our meals are prepared at our facility in Phoenix , Arizona and we &apos;re excited to announce that we &apos;re opening up another facility in Savage , Maryland in early 2019 !

We begin service in Fort Myers the second week of January ! 😃

We are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

( 07 : 51 : 18 PM ) Susie : Do you just heat them up ?

( 07 : 51 : 30 PM ) AJ : That &apos;s correct , Susie !

( 07 : 51 : 49 PM ) Susie : They will feed a family of 4

( 07 : 51 : 50 PM ) AJ : Your meals come fully cooked and you just need to microwave for 2-4 minutes depending on the meal , we provide instructions on each meal .

( 07 : 52 : 12 PM ) Susie : Is there a way to try it ? Although we ’ ll bave to wait until Jan

( 07 : 52 : 17 PM ) AJ : Currently , our meals are single servings intended for one person . We design our meals to be satisfying so that you will not go hunting for another snack later !

( 07 : 52 : 18 PM ) Susie : Are you in Naples yet

( 07 : 52 : 38 PM ) Susie : How much is it per meal ?

( 07 : 52 : 50 PM ) AJ : We aren &apos;t shipping to most of Florida until we open our new facility next month .

( 07 : 52 : 59 PM ) AJ : We currently offer four different meal plans for 4 , 6 , 9 , and 12 meals per week .

( 07 : 53 : 01 PM ) Susie : Could kids spilt one meal ?

( 07 : 53 : 12 PM ) AJ : These are priced at $ 49.99 , $ 59.99 , $ 89.99 , and $ 107.99 , respectively . Your plan of choice will arrive in a single shipment each week .

( 07 : 53 : 57 PM ) AJ : Our servings are designed for 1 person . If you look at our menu , you &apos;d see the size of each meal in terms of weight , calories , etc .

( 07 : 54 : 01 PM ) AJ : https : / / www.freshly.com / on-the-menu

( 07 : 54 : 08 PM ) Susie : Oh ok sounds good thanks so much

( 07 : 52 : 23 PM ) Mike : And with the same meals if I forget to change

( 07 : 52 : 26 PM ) Mike : ?

( 07 : 52 : 52 PM ) Samantha : We are an automatic weekly subscription service , and more orders will be planned until the subscription is cancelled .

( 07 : 52 : 57 PM ) Samantha : You do have the option to skip weeks you would not like meals .

( 07 : 53 : 02 PM ) Samantha : You can also change the meals each week .

( 07 : 53 : 23 PM ) Samantha : You would just want to make sure to change your order or skip it before the weekly deadline provided , or the default order will be automatically sent .

( 07 : 54 : 06 PM ) Mike : Ok cool

( 07 : 54 : 20 PM ) Mike : And I assume each meal is good for 5 days or so if kept in fridge ?

( 07 : 54 : 36 PM ) Mike : I &apos;d be ordering for me and my wife , dinner during the week .

( 07 : 54 : 36 PM ) Samantha : The meals that we send to customers have a use-by date of about 4 days after they are delivered - although the shelf life could vary slightly in some cases . You can check the “ use by ” date on a meal ’ s cardboard sleeve for more specifics regarding that meal itself .

( 07 : 54 : 39 PM ) Samantha : You may , if needed , freeze meals to make them last longer - in which case , when it comes time to heat the meals , simply microwave for one to two minutes from the frozen state prior to following the printed heating instructions .

( 07 : 55 : 19 PM ) Mike : cool

( 07 : 53 : 03 PM ) Kasandra : Sometimes when there is new zoning or rezoning an address will not show as correct .

( 07 : 53 : 33 PM ) Kasandra : There should be an option for you to override this message at checkout , but you have to be sure your address is completely correct otherwise the order will not arrive to you .

We updated our orders for this week but after receiving our box , the changes don ’ t appear to have applied . The last time we made an update we selected the option to apply the changes to future meals .


We now have more meals than we can use and meals that we didn ’ t want . This is the second time this has happened and we are wondering if there is something we can do to prevent this in the future .

Sent from my iPhoneHi there Sarah ,

Thank you for reaching out to us !

I &apos;m so very sorry for this experience , but I can certainly assist ! Sadly , I don &apos;t see that any changes were made to this week &apos;s delivery . When you make any changes to your deliveries , I would highly suggest refreshing your Meal Planner and double-checking the delivery to ensure that the changes were applied . We do also send an email reminder each week with the meals that are scheduled to be sent out to you . I definitely recommend keeping an eye out for that , so that you can make any changes if the selections look incorrect .

If you would please let me know which meals you received and which meals you were expecting for this delivery , then I can certainly proceed with helping you make this right !

I look forward to your reply , Sarah !

Customer Care SpecialistHi there Carrie ,

I hope this email finds you well !

I &apos;m reaching out to you because we were chatting earlier about updating your delivery address , but our chat was disconnected . My apologies for that ! I can confirm that your delivery address is now updated to 2117 North DuPont Highway , New Castle , DE 19720 . This address change applies to all future deliveries beginning with the delivery on Monday , January 07 . I truly hope this helps !

As a friendly reminder , we are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week ! Wednesday by 2PM PT would be your weekly deadline for making updates or skipping a delivery , since your deliveries are on Monday .

Carrie , please let me know if you have any questions or if I may be of any further assistance . Have a great day !

Hello roxanne !


I ’ m Brooke , the Head of Nutrition at Freshly . I saw you canceled your subscription recently because of concerns about sodium ... I &apos;m so sorry to hear this !


We truly value the opinions of our customers , so it would be super helpful for me to know what you &apos;re looking for when it comes to acceptable levels of sodium in your meals , as well as any other nutritional or dietary concerns you may have . In short - how could we make our meals better for you ?

Brooke S.

Head of NutritionHi Roxanne ,

Thanks for reaching out !

Every Freshly meal has been carefully crafted by our team of chefs and nutritionists using only real ingredients . As a little background , we create our menu around high-quality proteins , healthy fats , and complex carbs that come from nutrient-dense veggies , whole grains , and natural sweeteners . Some of the ingredients that we use naturally contain cholesterol , which is present in animal meats , dairy , and eggs .

The cholesterol in our meals is not derived from any additives or processed ingredients . We do not use any fillers or additives that some food companies use to reduce the amount of cholesterol present in their meals . Instead , we ’ re dedicated to using ingredients in their natural form to bring you foods that you can feel good about .

In general , our meals average about 80-90 mg of cholesterol , with meals as low as 60 mg of cholesterol .

The cholesterol percentages on our labels reflect the FDA recommended guidelines , however , each person ’ s intake or needs may vary . If you do have any specific medical concerns , we always recommend you check with your doctor to determine which meals are right for you . We ’ re constantly updating our menu to bring our customers new meals that appeal to a wide variety of taste and nutritional preferences !

I hope this information was helpful Roxanne . Please feel free to reach out !

( 06 : 48 : 23 PM ) Adam : As an FYI- we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged ) meals on a weekly basis .

In your subscription , you are able to plan out your menus for up to three weeks in advance .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Thursday , any changes to your weekly order , or if you decide to skip the week , would need to be made by Saturday , prior to 2 pm PT .

( 06 : 49 : 04 PM ) Adam : The meals will be delivered via OnTrac

( 06 : 51 : 40 PM ) Adam : We don &apos;t have meals that are specifically made for diabetics , but we have quite a few customers that order from us who are diabetic . This is mainly because we do not use any refined sugars , and focus on low-glycemic carb meals ( or simply low-carb meals ) . We always recommend that anyone with a pre-existing medical condition speak to their doctor before enjoying our meals to be sure you would be getting the proper nutrition for your dietary needs .

It is also disturbing to get no previous notice other than the selections disappearing . Not what I have experienced with Freshly in the past.Hi Bob ,

Thank you so much for reaching out to give your feedback ! I &apos;m not sure if you remember , but I had the pleasure of meeting you back when we were still at our little Tempe warehouse ( and I was the sole customer experience rep ) ! I can certainly understand being frustrated with this situation .

We did send out an email campaign to customers prior to this update to the menu selections , but I know sometimes those get lost in cyberspace or spam folders and the like .

Over time we have found that most customers solely utilize the entree options , so the decision was made to remove the few breakfast options in order to focus more diligently on quality , consistency , and variety with our entree options .

I &apos;m going to be sure to reach out to Mike and Carter to give them your feedback regarding the change as well as the notification of it . I &apos;m truly sorry for the frustration , and doubly sorry that we disappointed you , Bob .

Please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know if you have any other feedback or concerns ; I will absolutely be happy to help however I can . I hope you have a great weekend !



Fresh wishes ,

Customer Service Manager

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! I do remember you ! Thanks for replying .

I don &apos;t think I saw that notification , so it came as a complete surprise . I found out by noticing that I had 6 Penne Bolognase dinners coming ! 😜


I do understand this as a business decision and certainly don &apos;t have the data you do , but breakfast is the one meal that is harder for me to replace .


On another matter : I have a home in VA . Heading back there soon . Was wondering when the MD plant was going to start producing and wondering if we could be a part of the &quot; beta test &quot; ? 😊 Hi Bob ,

Thank you for the reply !

I completely understand that , regarding the breakfast . I personally struggle with making breakfast for myself consistently - ha ha ! Again , so sorry for the inconvenience the decision causes for you , though . We knew there would be some customers disappointed by it ; one of those tough business decisions , like you said !

Some awesome news ... the Maryland plant is going to start shipping out meals in January ! We have new customers on the east coast and in the midwest already signing up for their first deliveries ! If you want , we can get your address updated to the Virginia one for the first available week there . Just let me know if you &apos;d like to do that , and what the address is , and I &apos;ll be happy to get that taken care of for you !

I hope you have a great Sunday !

Just realized that I had this under drafts and never pushed the send button ... Duh ....


In any case :


Our address in VA is : 8815 Merseyside Lane , Chesterfield , VA 23832


When do you think you will be able to tell us when the first shipments will happen ? I will be in VA for holidays , but expecting to come back to AZ on about the 6th through the 18th , then back to VA .


Question : know that we will be a bit of a special case , but wondering how I can change my address in advance since I may be shifting back and forth between AZ and VA .


( Update : did find a way to change address on your web site , but wondering how far in advance I will need to input an address change . Any problems shifting back and forth ? )

Bob Bishop
520-240-2338 ( cell ) Hi Bob ,

Oh I &apos;ve been there before with draft emails - HaHa !

It &apos;s actually pretty easy to switch back and forth with your addresses ! I went ahead and added the VA address to your subscription settings page . So now if you go there and you click to change your address , you &apos;ll see both addresses available . The default one is the one that will automatically populate when we add a new previewed week to the left in your Meal Planner .

And then for individual weeks , you can simply click on the weeks over on the left side of your Meal Planner and change each address individually . We have the previewed weeks available 3 weeks in advance , so that &apos;s how much time you have to adjust the upcoming addresses as needed . Of course , always keep your weekly deadline in mind ! For your Thursday deliveries your deadline is always the Saturday prior , by 2pm PT .

It looks like you will be able to start getting deliveries in VA by Friday , January 11th !

Since you said you &apos;ll be in VA for the holidays ( and not receiving deliveries in AZ ) , I left your default address set to the VA one for now , so it will auto-populate to that one once the mid-January orders start being previewed in the Meal Planner . Here is a link with detailed instructions for changing your address week-by-week as needed :

How do I change my delivery address ?

Of course , we are always here to help as well ! If you have any difficulty with changing , we can take care of it for you . Let me know if you have any other questions for now , and have a wonderful day !

Sounds like this should be relatively easy .


My schedule is suddenly in flux for January , but I will keep the deadlines in mind .


Have a lot of people in VA I want to introduce Freshly to . Do you know if my &quot; bishop50off &quot; promo code is still active ?


Did they spirit you off to NYC , or are you still based in AZ ?


Happy Holidays !

When they initially moved the corporate offices to NYC I had the option to go also , but being from Michigan originally , I opted out of moving back to cold weather , so I &apos;m still out here in AZ . 😄

It looks like that specific promo code isn &apos;t active currently ( was set to end in August ) , but I &apos;m going to work on getting a new one for you so can start sharing with your VA friends ! I &apos;ll let you know as soon as I get that sorted out .

My sincerest apologies about the confusion . We have changed our deadline time to 2 pm PST . This means your deadline is now every Thursday before 2 pm PT , and will only change if you alter your delivery date .

Nonetheless , I can certainly assist with any meal changes on my end ! Please let me know which meals you would like in your December 18th order .

I look forward to hearing from you , Bahman . Please let me know if you have any other questions .

Thank you for reaching back out to us .

I am so very sorry , however since you have already been charged I am not able to change how many meals you receive , just what meals you receive . The 6 meal plan was selected for this order , so I need 6 meals to add .

I have selected the meals you mentioned previously , with duplicates of the Southwest Chicken Bowl and Chicken and Rice Pilaf for now . If you would like to add two different meals to your December 18th order , please do reach back out .

I hope this helps , Bahman . If there is anything else I can do to assist , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

1 Southwest Chicken Bowl
1 Korean-Style Shrimp
1 BBQ Shredded Beef
1 Chicken &amp; amp ; Rice Pilaf
1 Penne Bolognese
1 Homestyle Chicken



I have gone ahead and changed my profile to the 4 meal plan on the website . I wish you still had breakfast as an option .


Thanks .

Bahman EslambolyHello Bahman ,

Thank you for reaching back out .

I can confirm that I have updated your December 18th order to the meals you mentioned , and you can confirm this by accessing your meal planner . The 4 meal plan is selected as the default , beginning on December 31st .

We ’ re always working to meet the needs of our customers . We ’ re now focusing our attention on bringing more entrée variety to the menu — something we ’ ve gotten a lot of feedback about . To do this , we decided to remove the less popular breakfast options . In addition to more variety , we ’ ll be working to provide new ways to eat your favorite dishes , plus seasonal spins on your classic faves !

If you really love ( or miss ! ) a meal or have tips to make it better , be sure to let our chefs know by rating it in your account ! ​


I hope this helps , Bahman . If there is anything else I can do to assist please do not hesitate to let me know !

Customer Care SpecialistHey Stephanie ,

Thanks for calling in today !

Freshly is a great gift , so I &apos;m happy to hear that you &apos;ve shared it with Mark . Since you are interested in setting up your own Subscription , the easiest would be to add an additional one to your account . This way you have all the information in one place , and don &apos;t have to use different email addresses .

How do I add a new subscription to my account ?

The instructions are in the link above . If you have an issues , please reach out ! 😊 Any one of the Reps , can walk you through the process . Then when you are done with either of the subscriptions , we can easily cancel it out .

Since technically you &apos;ve already signed up , it may prevent you from using a promo code . Please try code : Rad40 . If the discount doesn &apos;t apply at sign up , I &apos;m happy to make a manual adjustment on the account . I &apos;ll be on the look out later today , to see if it &apos;s been activated . I wouldn &apos;t want you to lose out on that great promo , when you used it for a gift !

I hope this helps Stephanie ! If there is anything else I can assist you with , please don &apos;t hesitate to ask .

No worries ! I apologize for the confusion , it will be the same process but instead of the Nestle promo code , you will enter rad40 . This will provide you with a $ 20 discount off of your first two orders . Once the first two orders pass , you would need to manually update to your Nestle promo code in your subscription settings .

Customer Care SpecialistHi ,

My shipment was literally just dropped off . I was in the house and ran to the door when someone knocked . They didn &apos;t wait and just put it outside on the backup spot .
I brought it right in and the first two boxes I took out the cardboard was wet as if it had been leaked on . The brown cardboard was wet on those two boxes . I &apos;m not going to eat them because I don &apos;t know what leaked on them .
My number is 805-705-7755 .
I &apos;m going to temporarily stop deliveries until further notice .
Thank you .

115 E. 23rd St. , 7th Floor , New York , NY 10010Hi Millie ,

Thank you for reaching out to us , and I am so sorry for any trouble regarding your recent delivery !

For the wet meals , I &apos;ve gone ahead and reported this to our Quality Assurance team and applied an in-store credit of $ 20 to your subscription . This credit will be automatically applied to your next charged order and will be available on your subscription for up to 6 months until use .

I &apos;ve also cancelled your subscription , so you won &apos;t receive any further charges or deliveries from us until you &apos;re ready to come back to us . To start receiving deliveries again , you can simply reactivate your subscription . I &apos;ve included more information in the link below :

How do I reactivate my subscription ?

It sounds like condensation from the gel ice packs was the cause of the wet cardboard in your box . This is completely normal , however I do apologize for any mess ! If there was any damage to your package , the meals , or the gel ice packs , please let me know and I can get this further reported to our Quality Assurance team and have you accommodated . If you would be able to send pictures as well , this would greatly assist them in their investigation .

Please let me know if you have any other questions or if I can be of further assistance , Millie . I am happy to help !

Thank you for reaching out to us today !

All of our meals are based on incorporating whole foods like high-quality proteins , healthy fats , and nutrient dense veggies . This is similar to some of the principals of a Paleo diet . We do add in some beans , grains , and dairy for added variety .

From there , you can click on the image of the meal to be taken to all of the nutritional information and ingredients .

We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

There are limited characters that can be printed on the shipping label , however if you have any questions or need any assistance , please don &apos;t hesitate to reach out . We &apos;re always happy to help !

We use organic ingredients as often as possible , but organic is just one of many characteristics we use to evaluate the ingredients we purchase . We research our sources for ingredients extensively to ensure that we use suppliers that meet our standards for freshness and all-around excellence .

All of our meats are free from antibiotics and hormones , in accordance with federal regulations . Currently , we source chemical-free and antibiotic-free , farmed shrimp . The Salmon and Cod are wild-caught . The beef is not labelled as grass-fed .

Customer Care SpecialistHello !

First I want to start off by saying that I have been very much enjoying my Freshly orders thus far ! But had a question around delivery days for my area . Right now it looks like delivery days for Seattle 98117 are Wednesday , Thursday , Friday . Was wondering if your delivery partners were looking at extending delivery days to Saturday and Monday ( I know Sunday cannot be supported ) anytime soon . ? It would be super helpful / convenient ! Thanks for your time : )

Thank you ,

ElletteHello Ellette ,

Thank you for reaching out to Freshly today !

I apologize for any inconvenience with your deliveries . I &apos;m afraid we don &apos;t have any plans to extend delivery days to Saturday or Monday . Our meals are packaged to withstand two days of travel , with an extra 12 hours on top of that , as most of our customers reside in 2 day zones . Since the meals are cooked and shipped out of Phoenix , AZ that does limit the transit time frame to your zip code .

Again , my sincere apologies for this inconvenience , Ellette , and if you have any additional questions or concerns , please don ’ t hesitate to reach back out to me !

Pedro A.

Customer Care SpecialistHi there ,

I &apos;m newer to Freshly - I &apos;ve only had 1 delivery and have another one coming up . When I initially signed up , I had an offer for $ 15 off my first two orders . It worked on the first one , but I &apos;m not sure if it &apos;s going to work on the second one . I didn &apos;t see the discount in my confirmation email . Is this because I switched from 6 meals to 4 ?

Thank you !

Carly HHello Carly ,

Thank you for reaching out to us !

I took a look into your subscription and the promo code and the promo code is only meant for the 6 meal plan for 6 meals at $ 45 for each of your first 2 weeks . Since you had changed to the 4 meal plan , that is why it did not apply the discount for the second week for your Wednesday , December 19th order . However , I &apos;ve gone ahead and honored this as a courtesy and issued a refund in the amount of $ 14.99 back to your card on file . Please do allow up to 3-5 business days for the funds to post onto your bank account ( depending on your banking institution ) . Going forward , you will be charged the regular price of the 4 meal plan which is $ 49.99 per week .

Just as a friendly FYI , ( or reminder if you already knew ! ) we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Wednesday &apos;s , your weekly deadline to make changes is Thursday &apos;s before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :

Customer Care SpecialistHello ,


I order six meals for the week . Last night I noticed my final two meals were labeled use by 12 / 12 / 2018 , only five days after delivery . Today , 12 / 14 / 2018 , I received my weeks meals and found they all also have a use by date five days from now which is 12 / 19 / 2018 ( image attached ) .


I switched from Thursday delivery to Friday delivery recently but when I did Thursday delivery my meals typically covered a seven day use by period . I ’ ve also received unpredictable delivery times during the day since this switch .


Is there a particular day of the week to order for longer use by periods ? I order Freshly for my lunches at work so 5pm delivery is problematic . Also , my stomach is sensitive which is why I like your fresh food option . I noticed the change in use by date because my stomach has become upset after eating my last two meals of my last two deliveries .


I have set next week to skip until I know if this is still a good option for me . Thank you for any assistance you can offer .


-Nina Thurnbeck-


--
Nina ThurnbeckHello Nina ,

Thank you for reaching out !

I sincerely apologize for any confusion regarding the use by dates . Typically our meals will have a use by date of 4-5 days depending on each meal itself . The way that we cook our meals is that we go ahead and get the ingredients ready once the weekly deadline has passed as we want to wait for full confirmation of the order itself . Then from there it is around a day for prepping the meals and then another to cook them . Then from there they are shipped out to your doorstep , due to the way our system is setup to handle all our orders , changing the delivery day would not update any use-by dates as the meals will always be prepared a day before being shipped out .

I hope this helps Nina , and if you have any further questions or concerns don &apos;t hesitate to reach out !

UnsubscribeHello !

Thanks for reaching out ! I &apos;m AJ , and I &apos;ll be stepping in for my colleague , Megan this afternoon . I wish you a speedy recovery , I &apos;ll provide our phone number at the bottom of this email if you wish to speak about this with one of our associates .

A little about Freshly , we were started in Tucson , Arizona and now our headquarters is in New York City . Currently , all of our meals are prepared at our facility in Phoenix , Arizona and we &apos;re excited to announce that we &apos;re opening up another facility in Savage , Maryland in early 2019 !

We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help you manage a subscription if you decide you &apos;d like to give us a try :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


These are just a few of the really helpful links in our FAQ . You can always access even more information from our FAQ page by clicking on the &quot; Help &quot; tab in the upper right hand corner while logged into your account ! And of course , we are always happy to assist via email , text or phone at 844-FRESHLY or via chat ! Our current hours of operation are from 6am-11pm PT every day .

I hope this helps , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !








Fresh wishes ,

( 08 : 10 : 03 PM ) Eric : How can I assist ?

( 08 : 10 : 09 PM ) greg pontarola : I got my first week at the reduced price

( 08 : 10 : 23 PM ) greg pontarola : i get one more week but i think 6 meals is going to be too much

( 08 : 10 : 43 PM ) greg pontarola : if i change to the 4 meal option what happens on my second week with the reduced rate

( 08 : 10 : 53 PM ) Eric : Good question !

( 08 : 11 : 06 PM ) Eric : Since that promotion is only for the 6 meal plan , you would lose the discount .

( 08 : 11 : 41 PM ) greg pontarola : ok well ill keep it at 6 meals .. i suppose i can freeze a couple of meals although i know u guys don &apos;t really suggest we do that

( 08 : 12 : 20 PM ) Eric : We don &apos;t if you want them as fresh as possible but you certainly can .

( 08 : 12 : 22 PM ) Eric : I do !

( 08 : 12 : 31 PM ) greg pontarola : ok .. sounds good .. thanks for your help

( 08 : 12 : 32 PM ) Eric : In which case , when it comes time to heat the meals , simply microwave for one to two minutes from the frozen state prior to following the printed heating instructions .

( 08 : 12 : 37 PM ) greg pontarola : by the way i ate my first meal last night

( 08 : 12 : 43 PM ) greg pontarola : the steak one .. it was very good

( 08 : 12 : 50 PM ) Eric : I &apos;m glad you enjoyed it !

( 08 : 13 : 29 PM ) greg pontarola : should i puncture the cover when cooking out of the freezer ?

( 08 : 13 : 52 PM ) greg pontarola : i have a really powerful microwave so 2 minutes gets it ready to eat

( 08 : 13 : 57 PM ) Eric : Puncture it after the first time you heat it .

( 08 : 14 : 04 PM ) greg pontarola : oh ok

( 08 : 14 : 21 PM ) Eric : This way all the moisture that froze goes back to the meal instead of escaping .

( 08 : 14 : 32 PM ) greg pontarola : so i will get the discount on my second week then it goes to regular prices , correct ?

( 08 : 14 : 40 PM ) Eric : That is correct .

( 08 : 14 : 45 PM ) Eric : The regular price is $ 59.99

( 08 : 14 : 45 PM ) greg pontarola : ok thanks for yourhelp

( 08 : 14 : 49 PM ) greg pontarola : right

( 08 : 14 : 55 PM ) Eric : You can lower the price by referring friends or family however .

( 08 : 15 : 07 PM ) greg pontarola : although the 3rd week i may go to the 4 meals ... however its a better deal to get 6

( 08 : 15 : 28 PM ) Eric : The Get $ 40 link will allow you to send referral emails and once that person signs up , you get the same two week discount as when you signed up .

( 08 : 15 : 43 PM ) Eric : It would arrive as a code via email that you manually apply to your subscription .

( 08 : 16 : 04 PM ) greg pontarola : oh i see

( 08 : 16 : 09 PM ) greg pontarola : $ 20 off for 2 weeks

( 08 : 16 : 13 PM ) Eric : Correct !

( 08 : 16 : 20 PM ) Eric : That would work on any plan too

( 08 : 16 : 21 PM ) greg pontarola : ok , well thanks again .

So after your Sunday , December 16th order , your next open delivery will be Sunday , January 13th , does this sound correct to you , Rochelle ?

( 08 : 25 : 57 PM ) Samantha : For your late December 8th order , a full refund in the amount of $ 41.99 was issued on December 8th . I am very sorry if you have not yet received that , but if this is the case your bank will have more information about when they will be able to add the funds back to your account .

( 08 : 26 : 04 PM ) Samantha : Please give me one moment to look into the order for today .

( 08 : 27 : 04 PM ) Samantha : I do see that there was a delay with your order this week , and I apologize deeply for this ! I am not sure why this delay occurred , however , I will be letting our delivery specialist know about this so they can contact the carrier to try to find out more information .

( 08 : 27 : 27 PM ) Samantha : We have reached out to try to have this package stopped , however , there is a slight chance it may still arrive . If it arrives today , great ! You can still enjoy the meals . If they arrive tomorrow , the meals will need to be disposed of right away .

( 08 : 27 : 44 PM ) Samantha : To further express my apologies , I have issued a full refund in the amount of $ 29.99 to cover the cost of the meals this week . Refunds may take 3-5 business days to completely process , however this can vary depending on your bank . I &apos;ve also applied a 100 % in-store credit in the amount of $ 59.99 for the inconvenience . This credit will be automatically applied to your next charge with us and will be available for a one time use within the next 6 months .

( 08 : 29 : 17 PM ) Adam Shorts : Will that credit automatically apply to my next weeks order ? And I understand it ’ s the holiday times , but this is my first time trying this product out and 2 times in a row they were late and had to be thrown away . Thank you for coving my next weeks order .

( 08 : 30 : 06 PM ) Samantha : The delay could be due to the holiday season , and again , I am so very sorry for the inconveniences you have experienced in your first two deliveries . The 100 % in-store credit will be automatically applied to your next order , currently scheduled for December 21st .

( 08 : 30 : 28 PM ) Adam Shorts : Ok , great . Thanks for the help .

( 08 : 44 : 20 PM ) Marco : Okay , Sam , I am able to provide an in-store credit for the difference between the plans .

( 08 : 45 : 15 PM ) Marco : The difference for the in-store credit here would be $ 18.00 . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically apply toward your next charged order .

( 08 : 45 : 16 PM ) SamPrest : Thank you

( 08 : 33 : 50 PM ) Samantha : Hello Kristen !

( 08 : 33 : 58 PM ) Kristen Caron : My last two packages were sent to 2555 N Clark and that is my default address

( 08 : 34 : 09 PM ) Kristen Caron : But the update “ left at front door ” makes no sense

( 08 : 34 : 12 PM ) Samantha : The delivery address for an order can be viewed in your meal planner and in the email we sent you regarding the shipment .

( 08 : 34 : 15 PM ) Samantha : One moment while I pull up your subscription to look into this for you .

( 08 : 34 : 35 PM ) Samantha : Is this for your 9 meal plan or your 12 meal plan ?

( 08 : 35 : 39 PM ) Kristen Caron : This is ridiculous . We don ’ t live there anymore .

( 08 : 35 : 46 PM ) Kristen Caron : The food is likely gone

( 08 : 36 : 03 PM ) Samantha : I am very sorry to hear this , and I would be more than happy to help . Is this for your 9 meal plan or your 12 meal plan ?

( 08 : 36 : 15 PM ) Kristen Caron : Last week ’ s same subscription was sent to my new address

( 08 : 36 : 27 PM ) Kristen Caron : 9 meal

( 08 : 36 : 32 PM ) Kristen Caron : It was delivered hours ago .

( 08 : 37 : 19 PM ) Samantha : For the 9 meal plan , the order is due for delivery tomorrow and is scheduled to be shipped to the default address .

( 08 : 38 : 40 PM ) Kristen Caron : Okay whatever was delivered today was not

( 08 : 38 : 51 PM ) Samantha : It sounds like the order you are referring to is for the 12 meal plan , and that was sent to your previous default address . This is because December 14th was added to the meal planner when the old address was listed as the default . When you update the address , the change needs to be made in both the subscription settings as well as all orders that have already been planned in your meal planner .

( 08 : 39 : 09 PM ) Kristen Caron : So we ’ re probably out 12 meals and $ 108

( 08 : 39 : 10 PM ) Samantha : I am very sorry for any confusion regarding this , and I would be more than happy to accommodate you for this .

( 08 : 39 : 17 PM ) Samantha : Please give me one more moment to work on this for you .

( 08 : 40 : 37 PM ) Samantha : Just to clarify , the subscription that this order was on is set for 12 meals by default , however , the December 14th order was scheduled for 9 meals . To cover the cost of the order that went to the wrong address , I will be adding a 100 % in-store credit in the amount of $ 89.99 . This credit will be automatically applied to your next charge with us and will be available for a one time use within the next 6 months . You have already been charged for December 19th , so this credit will be applied to the following order .

( 08 : 42 : 45 PM ) Kristen Caron : Oh wow . Thank you !

( 08 : 42 : 55 PM ) Samantha : You &apos;re very welcome , Kristen .

( 08 : 43 : 36 PM ) Samantha : I notice there are some orders on each of your subscriptions that have the meal plans as different every week . Would you like me to organize this for you so one subscription only has the 9 meal plan and the other only as the 12 meal plan selected ?

( 08 : 44 : 54 PM ) Kristen Caron : No

( 08 : 45 : 08 PM ) Kristen Caron : We change it based on travel , etc .

( 08 : 45 : 13 PM ) Samantha : Okay . Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time ?

( 08 : 48 : 13 PM ) Kristen Caron : No i am all set thank you

( 08 : 48 : 23 PM ) Samantha : You &apos;re very welcome , Kristen .

( 08 : 48 : 33 PM ) Samantha : Thank you for reaching out to us regarding this , and I hope you have a great rest of your day .

( 08 : 50 : 46 PM ) Kristen Caron : Are all future orders for 2555 N Clark ?

( 08 : 34 : 13 PM ) AJ : Hi , James !

( 08 : 34 : 15 PM ) AJ : Thanks for contacting Freshly ! My name is AJ , and I &apos;ll be assisting you today .

( 08 : 34 : 34 PM ) AJ : We are a subscription service , meaning that we will renew your subscription every week , charge your card , and send you meals , unless you skip weeks or cancel the subscription .

( 08 : 34 : 54 PM ) AJ : We do our best to make this as clear as we can , by explaining during the sign-up process , including during checkout itself , and in the initial order confirmation email . There are no membership fees or cancellation fees .

( 08 : 34 : 59 PM ) AJ : Could you please verify the phone number associated with the subscription ?

( 08 : 35 : 23 PM ) James Mandella : 516-991-4141

( 08 : 35 : 30 PM ) AJ : Thanks , James .

( 08 : 35 : 57 PM ) James Mandella : I don ’ t want to make plans to receive any other orders until I try the food and feel that it ’ s suitable for me .

( 08 : 36 : 04 PM ) AJ : I completely understand !

( 08 : 36 : 18 PM ) AJ : I &apos;m sorry for the confusion and frustration . Give me just a moment to see if I can cancel this order .

( 08 : 36 : 30 PM ) James Mandella : Ok

( 08 : 36 : 33 PM ) AJ : Oh , you &apos;re all set , James !

( 08 : 36 : 47 PM ) AJ : You already skipped your second delivery correctly so you won &apos;t be charged .

( 08 : 37 : 38 PM ) James Mandella : Great . Can I wait until my first meals arrive to order more or will I have to skip orders every week until my order comes .

( 08 : 38 : 19 PM ) AJ : Given the subscription nature of our service you will be scheduled for your next deliveries and will need to skip those weeks if you don &apos;t wish to be charged .

( 08 : 38 : 34 PM ) James Mandella : Ok .

( 08 : 38 : 38 PM ) AJ : We send you email reminders to make changes !

( 08 : 38 : 53 PM ) James Mandella : So providing I skip I won ’ t be charged ?

( 08 : 38 : 58 PM ) AJ : That &apos;s correct .

( 08 : 39 : 04 PM ) James Mandella : 👍 🏼

( 08 : 39 : 12 PM ) AJ : As long as you cancel by your weekly deadline which is available on the top-right of the Meal Planner and we send this via email .

( 08 : 39 : 21 PM ) AJ : Is there anything else I can assist you with today ?

( 08 : 39 : 30 PM ) James Mandella : Thanks so much . Hope the foods great .

( 08 : 41 : 10 PM ) mark : ok thank you

( 08 : 41 : 16 PM ) AJ : Though we currently do not offer gift cards , you can order a subscription for someone else using your information and set the gift recipient ’ s address as the shipping address on the subscription . This would ensure that you are charged for the subscription , but that the gift recipient is the one who gets the meals .

( 08 : 41 : 19 PM ) AJ : To set up a menu for the first delivery , you &apos;ll want to get the recipients list of desired meals ( or select meals for them , ) then place the order ! We don &apos;t have trial options , so if you want to gift one week only you &apos;ll just need to cancel the subscription after the first order has been shipped . If you &apos;re ordering more than one week , you could share the login details with the recipient so they can make changes to their future orders ! The deadline to cancel or edit meals prior to the second order being charged will also be listed in your Welcome Email ! : - )

( 08 : 38 : 39 PM ) Alondra : I do apologize , as there was a delay during transit time and your meals will be arriving instead tomorrow Saturday , December 15th . Good news is that we package and design our meals to withstand up to 2-full days of transit time and up to 12 hours at your door . So being in a 1 day zone , you do have the extra buffer day , plus the 12 hours and the meals will still be safe to be consumed as long as your meals do arrive safely by tomorrow .

( 08 : 38 : 55 PM ) Alondra : To further express my apologies , I have gone ahead and applied a ( 20 % ) in-house credit in the amount of $ 12 onto your subscription for the inconvenience . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically be applied towards your next charged order .

( 08 : 59 : 56 PM ) MICHAEL PISCETELLI : This is insane three weeks ina row

( 09 : 01 : 58 PM ) Alondra : The meals did ship out on time according to the tracking information , so I am not sure as to what may have happened once it arrived at the FedEx location . However , please do know that our Delivery Specialist will go ahead and investigate further with the carrier . To further express my apologies , I ’ ve gone ahead and applied an in-house credit in the amount of $ 59.99 onto your subscription for the inconvenience and to cover the cost of those meals . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically be applied towards your next charged order at no additional cost to you .

( 09 : 06 : 57 PM ) katie : oh wellBecame super sick last time my girlfriend and I had Freshly ... I &apos;m sorry I &apos;ll never order it again . Even if you offered a lifetime supply for free .

Just hearing the name Freshly reminds me of the toilet and how much time I spent in there . The long nights hugging the base of that toilet .


Last week I saw a Freshly box and I gagged a little . That is not a joke nor an exaggeration .


Thanks for the offer though ,
FD

Hello Faizan !

I hope you ’ re having a great week ! I saw you canceled your subscription recently because you wanted more meal variety … I ’ m so sorry to hear this !

Since you &apos;ve been gone , we ’ ve added new meals to the menu , like Butternut Squash Risotto , Sausage Baked Penne , and Lebanese-Style Beef Meatballs .

Also , you need not receive meals every single week , but , instead , can skip weeks here and there and come back after we &apos;ve added some new , yummy meals to our menu ! I &apos;d be happy to help arrange this for you , should you be interested .

If you &apos;d like to give us a try again , I &apos;d like to offer you $ 10 off your next order . Just reactivate your subscription by clicking here , go to &quot; Subscription Settings &quot; , and add the code freshconnect389453 to your subscription ! The code will be active through January 7th .

And , of course , if you have any questions at all , I ’ d be more than happy to chat over email , text , or hop on a call ... whatever works for you !

Fresh wishes ,

Megan M.

( 08 : 39 : 51 PM ) Amber Pelot : Thanks

( 08 : 39 : 55 PM ) Eric : Of course !

( 08 : 40 : 00 PM ) Eric : One moment .

( 08 : 41 : 27 PM ) Eric : At the moment , the 26th is the furthest out we show . You would have to wait a week or two for the 9th to show up .

( 08 : 42 : 10 PM ) Amber Pelot : oh ok . So if I wait a week or two , I can log in and push it back to feb 9 ?

( 08 : 42 : 36 PM ) Eric : Correct !

( 08 : 42 : 45 PM ) Eric : You can also let us know in case you have any issues .

( 08 : 42 : 50 PM ) Amber Pelot : Ok , thanks ! Will do .

( 08 : 43 : 05 PM ) Eric : Is there anything else I can assist you with ?

( 08 : 43 : 58 PM ) Amber Pelot : Just to confirm we get this first week for the $ 40 , and then another for $ 40 ? And then it goes to the normal $ 60 / week rate ?

( 08 : 44 : 16 PM ) Amber Pelot : i had the $ 40 promo FYI .

( 08 : 44 : 53 PM ) Eric : Correct . Each week is discounted to $ 39.99 instead of the $ 59.99 regular price .

( 08 : 44 : 59 PM ) Eric : For two weeks .

( 08 : 45 : 39 PM ) Amber Pelot : And then it ’ ll automatically adjust to $ 59.99 without me doing anything further right ? Subscription will just continue without me having to take further action ?

( 08 : 45 : 54 PM ) Eric : That is correct !

( 08 : 25 : 29 PM ) Jay : My name is Jay , how can I assist you today ?

( 08 : 25 : 32 PM ) Fred Gallo : Had a quick question

( 08 : 25 : 37 PM ) Jay : Certainly .

( 08 : 25 : 49 PM ) Fred Gallo : It says changes to my default plan change Jan 27

( 08 : 26 : 00 PM ) Fred Gallo : Can u tell me what that includes ? ? ? ?

( 08 : 26 : 43 PM ) Jay : One moment while I pull up your subscription to look into this for you !

( 08 : 27 : 13 PM ) Jay : Were you making edits to your subscription when this popped up ?

( 08 : 27 : 39 PM ) Fred Gallo : No

( 08 : 27 : 49 PM ) Fred Gallo : It ’ s just on my subscription info

( 08 : 28 : 09 PM ) Fred Gallo : I did put in a coupon code when I enrolled though

( 08 : 28 : 23 PM ) Jay : I am not showing Jan. 27th is open to edit at this time ! This is because the Meal Planner only shows 2-3 out from the current day .

( 08 : 28 : 44 PM ) Jay : Yes , I &apos;m showing that code Launch15 applied to your first order on Jan. 6th

( 08 : 29 : 06 PM ) Fred Gallo : So the 59.99 a month that includes shipping correct ? ?

( 08 : 29 : 29 PM ) Jay : We are a subscription service , meaning that we will renew your subscription every week , charge your card , and send you meals , unless you skip weeks or cancel the subscription .

( 08 : 29 : 32 PM ) Jay : Freshly currently offers four different meal plans for 4 , 6 , 9 , and 12 meals per week .

( 08 : 29 : 34 PM ) Jay : These are priced at $ 49.99 , $ 59.99 , $ 89.99 , and $ 107.99 , respectively . Your plan of choice will arrive in a single shipment each week .

( 08 : 29 : 47 PM ) Jay : Since you are on the 6 meal plan , you &apos;ll be charged $ 59.99 / week .

( 08 : 29 : 56 PM ) Jay : Unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription .

( 08 : 30 : 10 PM ) Fred Gallo : Ok perfect

( 08 : 30 : 20 PM ) Fred Gallo : Any other promotions I can take advantage of ? ?

( 08 : 30 : 47 PM ) Jay : We typically hold 1-2 promotions each month and send them to you via email ! So I &apos;d suggest keeping an eye out .

( 08 : 30 : 58 PM ) Jay : You can use the code Radspring30 for 30 % off your next order .

( 08 : 31 : 03 PM ) Jay : Here is how to apply a promo code to your subscription :

( 08 : 31 : 27 PM ) Jay : If you were not aware already , your weekly deadline is every Wednesday at 2pm PT . After this time , you won &apos;t have access to skip the week or edit your order .

( 08 : 31 : 35 PM ) Fred Gallo : Awesome I appreciate it

( 08 : 31 : 42 PM ) Jay : My pleasure Fred !

( 08 : 31 : 49 PM ) Fred Gallo : And one more question

( 08 : 31 : 58 PM ) Jay : Certainly .

( 08 : 32 : 17 PM ) Fred Gallo : It took like 3-4 weeks to get my first order set up and delivered did I do something wrong

( 08 : 32 : 27 PM ) Fred Gallo : Or is that how it is when u sign up

( 08 : 33 : 06 PM ) Jay : No . The delivery day would be a few weeks out due to the carrier &apos;s holiday schedule and high delivery volume . Once you receive your first delivery , your meals would be delivered weekly . My apologies for that !

( 08 : 33 : 30 PM ) Fred Gallo : It ’ s ok just marking sure

( 08 : 33 : 34 PM ) Fred Gallo : Ok thanks again

( 08 : 33 : 39 PM ) Fred Gallo : Have a good new year

( 09 : 22 : 11 PM ) * * * Taylor left the chat * * * This is the 4th time that I have had issues with your delivery . On Wednesday December 26th , when I looked at my account , you showed I was set up for delivery today the 29th . After not receiving my order , I spoke with Madison who said I wouldn &apos;t receive meals today due to limited delivery . I never received notification that I wouldn &apos;t receive my meals . I looked at my account and today it shows that . Your company continues to fail in customer service ! Hello Sharon !

Thank you so much for your message !

I &apos;m terribly sorry for any inconvenience regarding not receiving meals this week . As Madison had mentioned in your phone call earlier , we were not able to service your area due to our production facility being closed for the holidays . We had this week listed as &quot; Not Available &quot; in your Meal Planner for three weeks prior , but I completely understand your frustration . It looks like the soonest we can send out meals to you would be for your next scheduled delivery on January 5th .

I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t see the week listed as available in your Meal Planner on our end . I see in the notes from your phone call with Madison that she said you &apos;d send in a screenshot showing that December 29th was listed as scheduled on your end . Can you please send in that screenshot for us if you can ? I &apos;d greatly appreciate it !

In the meantime , I have issued an in-store credit of $ 20.00 on your subscription for the trouble . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically apply toward your next charged order .

I truly do apologize about this , Sharon . I look forward to your reply !

Customer Care SpecialistHello Victoria ,

When I opened the app , it no longer showed this day being available . So , I cannot send the screen shot . On Wednesday , it did show available . Not once in the past 3 weeks did I see in my account anywhere that today was not available . As a matter of fact , I actually updated which meals I wanted for today . When I skipped last week , there wasn &apos;t anything to indicate today wasn &apos;t available .

I am not trying to get anything for free , I plan my week around the delivery and it continues to be a problem with delivery .

Sharon

{ direction : rtl ; unicode-bidi : embed ; } Hello Sharon !

Thanks for your response !

I &apos;m deeply sorry for any trouble . I &apos;m not sure why your Meal Planner would show that December 29th is available , but as we are not able to service your area this week . I understand how frustrating this may seem , especially since this is not the first time you have experienced trouble with your deliveries . The Meal Planner should list the week as &quot; Not Available &quot; when you click on the delivery date as well . I appreciate you trying to give us a screenshot , though !

I issued the in-store credit of $ 20.00 on your subscription for the inconvenience . I am terribly sorry about all of this , and I wish there was more I could do !

Please know that when any issues arise with the carrier regarding your delivery , our Senior Delivery Specialist contacts the carrier directly to see what went wrong . We take these issues very seriously , and do our best to try and prevent them from happening .

Again , my sincerest apologies , Sharon . If you should need anything further , please let me know .

Customer Care SpecialistLoved your food on day one , but then realized with the holiday that we should probably freeze our food . We thawed it today and my husband is currently getting sick . I can only attribute it to your food considering that him and I both ate different entrées and I am fine . I don ’ t usually ask for this , but I would like a refund . Nowhere on your website does it say that you have to eat the meals within three days . I ordered six meals . Hence , I froze multiple meals . Needless to say , I will not be ordering from you again . The least you can do is refund me . Thank you.Hello Ashley ,

Thank you for reaching out to Freshly !

I &apos;m sorry to hear about your husbands discomfort . While you can certainly freeze our meals to extend the shelf life , it is listed on our site , that the meals should not be thawed . Freshly is a fresh never frozen service , however , we don &apos;t use any artificial or chemical preservatives . We do not recommend thawing the meals , but rather heating them from frozen .

Can I freeze my meals ?

In light of the confusion , I &apos;ve refunded this order . You should expect that refund to post in 3 - 5 business days . I would suggest that you dispose of any remaining meals that have been thawed . If you wish to reactivate and try another delivery , I &apos;ve also replaced your discount .

I hope this helps Ashley . If there is anything else I can assist you with , please don &apos;t hesitate to ask .

Thank you so much for getting back to me !

I &apos;m glad that I could assist with your refund , and I &apos;m sorry it wasn &apos;t under better circumstances . I was a bit early when I responded to you this morning , but I was wondering if you had a few moments to talk this afternoon ? Especially since your husband wasn &apos;t feeling well , even though you were okay , I &apos;d like to ask some follow up questions for my Team . It should only take a few minutes , but if you &apos;re busy , I can send them via email as well !

Thank you again for bringing this to my attention Ashley . I look forward to your reply . 😊

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Hi Erin ,

Please see my answers below in bold . I should clarify that the food was never thawed to room temperature , but pulled from the freezer and into the fridge so when re heated they were still partially frozen .


I really appreciate all your help .

( 05 : 12 : 31 PM ) Taylor : Hi Joan !

( 05 : 12 : 53 PM ) Taylor : Thanks for reaching out to Freshly ! We don &apos;t have meals that are specifically made for diabetics , but we have quite a few customers that order from us who are diabetic . This is mainly because we do not use any refined sugars , and focus on low-glycemic carb meals ( or simply low-carb meals ) . We always recommend that anyone with a pre-existing medical condition speak to their doctor before enjoying our meals to be sure you would be getting the proper nutrition for your dietary needs .

( 05 : 14 : 32 PM ) Joan Wagner : Thanks .... gonna give this a try can u quit any time ?

( 05 : 14 : 32 PM ) Taylor : You &apos;re more than welcome to take a look at our menu here : https : / / www.freshly.com / on-the-menu - clicking on any meal will reveal all details , ingredients and nutritional information .

( 05 : 14 : 56 PM ) Taylor : My pleasure , Joan ! We don &apos;t have trial options , so if you want to try one week only you &apos;ll just need to cancel the subscription after the first order has been shipped . The deadline to cancel prior to the second order being charged will also be listed in your Welcome Email !

( 05 : 15 : 03 PM ) Joan Wagner : Super thank you so much

( 09 : 47 : 13 PM ) Donna : What about the second week ? Also , are there different meals to choose from for each week ?

( 09 : 47 : 53 PM ) Jay : Since we are a weekly subscription , your 2nd order is not charged until 5-6 days before the delivery . So you &apos;ll be charged for the Jan. 25th order on Jan. 20th .

( 09 : 47 : 57 PM ) Jay : We want to ensure the best variety in tastiness for our customers , so we add one new meal ( sometimes two ) to our menu almost every week . This would either involve adding in a completely new meal or revamping a pre-existing meal to make it even more delicious .

( 09 : 48 : 52 PM ) Donna : I did not choose the second week yet

( 09 : 49 : 33 PM ) Jay : We are a subscription service , meaning that we will renew your subscription every week , charge your card , and send you meals , unless you skip weeks or cancel the subscription .

If no new meals are chosen for the following week , you &apos;d be sent the same selections as the previous week unless you skip the week or cancel your subscription .

Thank you for reaching out to us here at Freshly !

I &apos;m happy to assist you further ! We always offer a handful of vegetarian meals on the menu at any given time . While we don ’ t develop vegan meals at the moment , some of our veggie meals qualify as vegan . We list each meal ’ s ingredients so you always know what ’ s in your meals .

We ’ re a weekly subscription meal service that delivers fresh ( not frozen ) prepared meals , developed by our team of chefs and nutritionists . They ’ re fully cooked so all you have to do is heat ‘ em up — each meal is ready to eat in only 3 minutes . So no more worrying about what ’ s for dinner ( or lunch ! ) . No shopping , no chopping , no cleanup . But also no artificial ingredients , preservatives or added sugars .

We started Freshly because we believe eating fresh , nutritious dishes every day should be easy for everyone . So we do all the hard work for you — sourcing high-quality ingredients , making sure each meal you eat is nutrient dense and packed with the good stuff , and expertly cooking your food to order so it tastes fresh and delicious .

I hope this was helpful , Loria ! If you have any additional questions , please feel free to reach back out to me !

UnsubscribeHello there !

Thanks so much for reaching out to us !

I &apos;m terribly sorry for any confusion before . You can disregard this email , since your wife has already joined us !

Just as a friendly reminder , we are a weekly based subscription service . This means you &apos;ll have an automatic charge and shipment of meals each week . You can skip weeks before your weekly deadline listed in your Meal Planner , if you don &apos;t want to receive meals weekly .

I hope this helps . If you should need anything further , please let me know !

Customer Care SpecialistDo you have Keto friendly optionsHi Lance ,

Thanks for reaching out !

While we don &apos;t necessarily design our meals to be ketogenic , we do have many customers who order from us as part of their keto plans . Our entrées start as low as 11 grams of net carbs .

Because “ low carb ” does not have one standard FDA definition , goals for eating “ low carb ” vary . Did you have a specific goal in mind ? If not , that ’ s OK . As a point of reference , the current FDA regulations are 300 grams of carbs per day and the average day Freshly meal is about 40 grams , with meals as low as 16 grams .

However , if you have any pre-existing medical conditions , we do recommend that you work with your doctor or nutritionist to determine what meals are right for you .


Buffalo Chicken with Loaded Cauliflower
Sicilian Style Chicken Parm with Brocoli
Slow Cooked Beef
Sausage and Peppers with Cauliflower Rice


I hope this was helpful , Lance . Please let me know if I can answer any additional questions , and have an awesome day !

UnsubscribeHi Carmelita ,

Thank you for your response . I &apos;m so sorry for the trouble , and I completely understand !

At this time , we are a weekly subscription service by nature . I &apos;m afraid we do not currently offer trial weeks . However , should you wish to give the service a try , you can always cancel the subscription after your first order has been shipped and reactivate if you wish to continue . I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help manage a Freshly subscription :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?



I hope this helps , Carmelita , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know . I &apos;m happy to help !

Have a wonderful day , and thank you for your interest in Freshly !

UnsubscribeHello Carolyn ,

Thank you for reaching out with this question today ! I &apos;ll be happy to help .

As a little background , we create our menu around high-quality proteins , healthy fats , and complex carbs that come from nutrient-dense veggies , whole grains , and natural sweeteners .

While we don &apos;t necessarily design our meals to be ketogenic , we do have many customers who order from us as part of their keto plans . When it comes to keto , the amount of carbs that each person can consume to stay in ketosis may vary . We know that customers who follow a keto diet tend to focus on net carbs ( total carbs minus fiber , which results in the amount of total absorbable carbs ) . In that case , our meals begin as low as 11 grams of net carbs ( not including our omelettes , which fit nicely into a keto plan ) .

Here are a few options of meals below 25 grams of net carbs :

- Buffalo Chicken Breast 16g carbs / 12g net carbs
- Sicilian-Style Chicken Parm 16g carbs / 11g net carbs
- Jamaican-Style Chicken 24g carbs / 19g net carbs
- Spaghetti Squash &amp; amp ; Meatballs 25g carbs / 22g net carbs
- Slow Cooked Beef Chili 26g carbs / 19g net carbs
- Cauliflower Sausage and Peppers 27g carbs / 23g net carbs

We recently launched a sort feature in the top righthand corner of the &quot; Choose Meals &quot; page so you can sort by carbs , from lowest to highest . This tool is useful if you have a specific carb goal in mind . However , if you have any pre-existing medical conditions , we do recommend that you work with your doctor or nutritionist to determine what meals are right for you .

I hope this was helpful , Carolyn . Please let me know if I can answer any additional questions , and have a wonderful day !

( 07 : 35 : 53 PM ) Adam : Thank you ! One moment !

( 07 : 38 : 38 PM ) Adam : I got that changed for you ! As an FYI , We are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged ) meals on a weekly basis .

In your subscription , you are able to plan out your menus for up to three weeks in advance .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Wednesday , any changes to your weekly order , or if you decide to skip the week , would need to be made by Friday , prior to 2 pm PT .

( 07 : 39 : 01 PM ) Adam : You should see that address update now on your end as well !

Customer Care Specialist ( 2 / 2 ) ternet issue and that my order will be shipped this week. this is for the 29th.325-721-5060I &apos;m very sorry , but it looks like the order for December 29th was skipped in your Meal Planner on December 24th at 12 : 23pm . I &apos;m afraid I am not able to unskip the order , as your weekly deadline has passed . I truly wish there was more I could do !

Customer Care Specialist ( 1 / 2 ) this is the second time my order has been messed up and i &apos;ve only had it 3 weeks. there has to be something you all can do . 1 / 3 success rate is terrible . ( 2 / 2 ) i do love the idea of this service especially with my ailments. can you check with a supervisor ? I do apologize about all of this , Joseph ! I know it was not your intention to have this week skipped , but I see that it was skipped on December 24th in your Meal Planner . The soonest we can get another shipment out to your area is your next scheduled delivery date on January 5th .

Customer Care Specialist ( 1 / 2 ) i see on my planner it was skipped also. so please , check why your system erroneously skipped my entire food for a week. open a defect to your software t ( 2 / 2 ) eam and please check with higher authority figures to see if they have a way that you may be unaware of to rectify a 1 : 3 success rate.I understand your frustrations , Joseph , and I really do apologize . I see that is was on the user end that the week was skipped , as listed in the notes on your subscription . I don &apos;t believe it was a system error , but I know you mentioned that you did not recall skipping that week . All I see on my end is that the week was skipped by the user on December 24th at 12 : 23pm . If you would like , I can certainly get a supervisor for you .

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! I &apos;m afraid the earliest we can get meals out to you would be January 5th , as our meals are cooked from scratch , and do require several days of prep , cook , and ship time . While I am unable to get an order shipped out to you any earlier , I have placed a 50 % in house credit on your subscription for your next 12 meal order . This would apply automatically to your 1 / 5 / 19 order when it has charged .

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Hi Mandy ,

Thanks for your patience ,

I have heard from our Shipping Department and they were unable to update the address so we are now reaching out to the carrier to see if it can be completed through FedEx .

This may delay your package by one day but the good news is , our meals are packed to stay cool and fresh for up to two days worth of transit , plus twelve hours on your doorstep . With you being in our one-day delivery zone , this means your meals will still be fresh if they arrive to you on Saturday , December 15th .

Once I hear if this can be completed , I will reach back out !

Thank you again for your patience !

I do see that an address change was requested with the carrier by our Delivery Specialist . I &apos;m afraid that the address on your tracking information would still show your old address .

Thank you for reaching out to us today ! Correct , we currently do not offer gift cards but you can definitely send an order by creating a new subscription under your own account . You would have to manually choose the meals yourself or can give the recipient your login information to proceed . I &apos;ve provided a helpful link below on how to add that subscription :

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! My concern is that it seems that the last time I received my shipment of meals , I checked the &quot; Best By &quot; date on all of them and the date was within 2 days and there &apos;s no way that I can eat 6 meals within 2 days ...

I &apos;m just now learning on your site that I can freeze meals . How long can I freeze a meal before I need to eat ? thank you so much ! ! ! Hi Cherie ,

Thank you for contacting Freshly !


I &apos;m so sorry for any confusion regarding freezing your meals and the expiration date .

Your meals should last about 5 days after receiving them , unless you freeze them to add shelf life . You can freeze them as long as you desire , some customers have done this for weeks at their convenience to accommodate their needs . If , your meals expired 2 days after you received them , would you mind sending us a picture of the expiration dates on the bottom of your meals , so we can investigate this .

Can I freeze my meals ?

I hope this information was helpful , Cherie . If you have any further questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to contact us .

Thank you , have a great day !

Thank you for reaching out to us !

I am so sorry for any confusion this has caused you ! I do see that there were two subscriptions under your name , and while one was canceled , the other remained open , hence the confusion this has caused .

I have gone ahead and canceled the second subscription for you as well , so you will no longer receive any further charges or deliveries unless you choose to reactivate . I have also gone ahead and issued a refund in the amount of $ 59.99 to cover the cost of the meals for which you were charged . Please allow 3-5 business days for that credit to appear on your account depending on your bank .

While we &apos;re certainly sorry to see you go , I hope you &apos;ve enjoyed your time with Freshly and will consider joining us again in the near future . We have lots of new and exciting changes and many more delicious meals on the horizon ! If you &apos;d like to cancel , please click on the link below :

Hey there ,



Have you ever wished that you could just snap your fingers after a long day and a nutritious dinner would appear ?

UnsubscribeHello Karen !

Thank you so much for reaching out to us , and for your interest in Freshly !

I &apos;m sorry for any confusion . While we don &apos;t necessarily design our meals to be ketogenic , we do have many customers who order from us as part of their keto plans . Our entrées start as low as 11 grams of net carbs . When you click on the picture of a meal you are interested in on our menu , you can access the &quot; Ingredient &quot; and &quot; Nutrition &quot; tabs ! This will list all of the details about each meal . Here is a link to our menu , which shows all of the meals available for selection :


Freshly Menu





We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help you manage a subscription if you decide you &apos;d like to give us a try :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


I hope this helps , Karen , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !



Fresh wishes ,
Victoria R.

Customer Care SpecialistThank you . The meals look yummy and your service seems top notch with listing all the ingredients and nutrients . It looks like you are reaching a broad audience with all of your options . We will keep this in mind after my husband and I lose our weight going full-on Keto for a few months . Then when it comes to maintenance , these meals will be awesome .


Thank you again . My son is very happy with your service too .

Freshly Customer Care ,
Pedro A.

Customer Care SpecialistHi there ,

My father is on a very low salt diet and is having a hard time cooking for himself these days . Are you able to accommodate for low salt ( and preferably no salt ) needs ?

Thank you !

Sent from my iPhoneHello Larisa ,

Thank you for reaching out today with your question ! I &apos;m happy to help .

As a little background , we create our menu around nutrient-dense veggies , high-quality proteins , and healthy fats , and season our meals using sea salt , herbs , and spices . We never use flavor enhancers or other artificial ingredients that can drive unhealthy levels of sodium .

The sodium in our meals is a combo of sodium that ’ s naturally occurring in the ingredients themselves ( a medium carrot has about 50 mg of sodium alone ! ) , and a mineral-dense sea salt that we use to season our meals . ( We encourage our customers to add any additional seasonings based on their personal preferences . )

Our meals average about 700 mg of sodium per dish , which is less than a third of the FDA ’ s daily recommendation of 2,300 mg . We always offer a range of dishes under 600 mg .

We work hard to offer a better , fresher alternative to other convenience-type or packaged foods that are high in sodium . For example , our Sicilian-Style Chicken Parm contains about 580 mg of sodium , while a similar dish at a local chain restaurant may contain between 2,500-3,000 mg of sodium .

We recently launched a sort feature in the top righthand corner of the &quot; Choose Meals &quot; page so you can sort by sodium , from lowest to highest ( some of our meals are as low as 300-400 mg ) . This tool is useful if you have a specific nutritional preference or goal in mind . However , if your father has any pre-existing medical conditions , we do recommend that he work with his doctor or nutritionist to determine what meals are right for him .

I &apos;ve gone ahead and provided our currently lowest sodium dishes below :



Meal
Sodium


Southwest Veggie Bowl
370


Butternut Veggie Risotto
490


Korean-Style Shrimp
500


Sicilian- Style Chicken Parm with Broccoli
520


Southwest Chicken Bowl with Cilantro-Lime Vinaigrette
540


Chicken &amp; amp ; Rice Pilaf with Butternut Squash and Green Beans
540


Teriyaki Salmon Cakes
560


Grilled Chicken Risotto with Butternut Squash
570




I hope that this was helpful , Larisa . Please let me know if I can answer any additional questions , and have a great day !

Wellness Specialisthooray ! !

Sent from Yahoo Mail on AndroidHello Kathleen ,

Thank you for reaching out to us !

I &apos;m glad to see you &apos;re so excited ! I am myself ! We &apos;ve been trying to find a way to have a peel-able film on our meals for the longest time . The main hurdle was that the seal was to weak to survive transit , and would cause meals to spill out of their containers . We &apos;re confident in this seal though ! We &apos;ve been working to do our best to get this rolled out , so please stay tuned for it going live !

Thank you , and have a great day Kathleen !



Fresh wishes ,
Benito D.

Customer Service SpecialistWhat is the commitment for this ? For example , if I don ’ t like the meals can I cancel right away or is there a certain time period or number of meals ? Does it always have to be 6 meals / week ? I eat out often so this is too many on a consistent basis

Customer Care SpecialistHello ,

I see you are now delivering to my zip code , which is awesome . When I went to choose my delivery date , it only showed for next year dates , would I be charged now or a week from the delivery ? Hello there !

Thank you so much for reaching out to us , and for your interest in Freshly !

Since our second facility is up and running , but we are unable to start shipping orders until next month ! So , we still made the delivery dates available to be for next year since we know how excited our customers were ! Now , to answer your question , the first shipment will charge you now , as you are placing an order with us , but going forward , it will only charge you if a week is left opened after the deadline passes !

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Hi Megan and Customer Care Team at Freshly ,

Thank you so much for reaching out , I appreciate it ! I am seriously considering your service for Christmas presents for my Mother and Grandmother ( two separate households ) , and I had a few questions :


1 ) Can I create two separate orders ( gift orders ) to be sent to different addresses using my email / account ? Or how would this work , if it &apos;s possible ?


2 ) Can I have deliveries be every other week ? Or could I just go in and manually skip a week ? Every week would be too many meals for each of them .


3 ) I am still trying to confirm a few details on delivery for each of them , is it possible to get the coupon extended through the weekend ? I should hopefully have the answers by then .


Thank you in advance for assisting me with these questions , I appreciate it !

I &apos;m so sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you , and I &apos;d be happy to assist !

I &apos;m afraid we &apos;ve found that customers who initially signed up with PayPal are not able to switch to just a credit / debit card without PayPal . This issue is currently being looked into , and our site engineers are working hard to resolve this !

To use a different payment method , you would either need to change your payment method in PayPay or cancel your current subscription and create a new one with the new card you want to use . You don &apos;t have to start the sign-up process again , and I &apos;ve included more information on adding a new subscription below :

Wellness SpecialistI got the wrong meal this week -- received southwestern veggie bowl instead of pork al pastor , which is one of my faves and not on the menu for next time ! Hello Jennifer ,

Thank you for reaching out to us today .

I &apos;m so very sorry to hear that you received incorrect meals . While we pride ourselves on high levels of accuracy , when cooking and shipping nearly 300,000 meals per week , mistakes can occasionally happen . We &apos;re always seeking to improve our service ! The good news is , not only have we recently beefed up our quality assurance team to help avoid incidents such as this , but we are on the cusp of opening a brand new , state-of-the-art facility on the east coast to help us better serve our customers during our continued growth .

To further express my apologies , I will be adding a $ 25 in-store credit to your subscription to cover double the cost of this incorrect meal . This credit will be automatically applied to your next charge with us and is available for a one time use within the next 6 months .

Again , I apologize for the inconvenience this week , Jennifer ! If there is anything else I can do to help today , please do not hesitate to let me know as I would be happy to further assist .

( 09 : 00 : 10 PM ) Samantha : I am so very sorry to hear this !

( 09 : 00 : 14 PM ) Samantha : One moment while I pull up your subscription to look into this for you /

( 09 : 01 : 10 PM ) Samantha : Because the meals are scheduled to arrive to you today , we need to allow the carrier the entire day to make sure those meals arrive . The tracking information could simply not have been updated properly , so we would need to wait and see if they are able to make that delivery . ,

( 09 : 01 : 15 PM ) Samantha : I apologize for any inconvenience .

( 09 : 02 : 10 PM ) Cornetta : ok , but this has happened before .

( 09 : 03 : 00 PM ) Samantha : I do see that here as well , and I apologize for that . A full refund in the amount of $ 39.99 was issued for that order , as well as a $ 30 in-store credit which was applied on this order .

( 09 : 03 : 17 PM ) Samantha : Even though this has happened before , we need to allow the carrier their entire business day to make the delivery .

( 09 : 03 : 44 PM ) Cornetta : Ok . I &apos;ll wait . Thank you for your assistance .

( 09 : 02 : 39 PM ) Jacklyn : Ty

( 09 : 03 : 38 PM ) Josh : So , I think the issue is that the subscription was never actually cancelled after the first order . Since I cannot issue a full refund for this order , for the confusion , I can issue a 50 % refund to the order which would be a refund for $ 30.00 .

( 09 : 03 : 50 PM ) Josh : I Can then cancel the subscription from our end to ensure no further orders are filled .

( 09 : 04 : 19 PM ) Jacklyn : I did cancel the subscription .

( 09 : 04 : 39 PM ) Jacklyn : After I received the first order

( 09 : 04 : 50 PM ) Jacklyn : I refused the package today .

( 09 : 05 : 35 PM ) Josh : I have issued a full refund in the amount of $ 59.99 to your account . Please allow 3-5 business days for those funds to post to your account ( depending on your financial institution ) .

( 09 : 05 : 39 PM ) Josh : I can confirm for you that your subscription is cancelled . You will not have any additional payments unless you choose to reactivate your subscription in the future .

( 09 : 05 : 42 PM ) Josh : I am sorry for any confusion .

( 09 : 05 : 47 PM ) Jacklyn : Thank you !

( 09 : 03 : 03 PM ) AJ : Thanks for contacting Freshly ! My name is AJ , and I &apos;ll be assisting you today .

( 09 : 03 : 15 PM ) AJ : I &apos;m glad you reached out today .

( 09 : 03 : 28 PM ) AJ : We are actually a subscription service , meaning that we will renew your subscription every week , charge your card , and send you meals , unless you skip weeks or cancel the subscription .

( 09 : 03 : 43 PM ) AJ : We do our best to make this as clear as we can , by explaining during the sign-up process , including during checkout itself , and in the initial order confirmation email .

( 09 : 04 : 28 PM ) Linh Nguyen : I see . Am I able to pause the subscription at any point ? Or would have to cancel so that it doesn ’ t continue to get charged ?

( 09 : 04 : 36 PM ) AJ : Great question !

( 09 : 04 : 48 PM ) AJ : I &apos;ll explain further for you . 🙂

( 09 : 05 : 46 PM ) AJ : We will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious ( If I do say so myself ) meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week !

( 09 : 06 : 05 PM ) AJ : As long as you skip before your weekly deadline , you won &apos;t be charged . You &apos;re normally able to skip 3 weeks out !

( 09 : 06 : 21 PM ) AJ : And of course , you can cancel your subscription at any time and not have to worry about skipping .

( 09 : 07 : 17 PM ) Linh Nguyen : I see .... okay so you can skip 3 weeks out and decide if I wanted to can just reorder .

( 09 : 07 : 33 PM ) AJ : Yes , up to 3 weeks . Your deadline is typically 6 days prior to delivery .

( 09 : 08 : 08 PM ) Linh Nguyen : Okay because I ’ d like to make sure it ’ s something I like enough to continue on a reaccuring without having the issue of being charged prior .

( 09 : 27 : 40 PM ) Samantha : I do see that there was a delay with your order this week , and I apologize deeply for this ! I am not sure why this delay occurred , however , I will be letting our delivery specialist know about this so they can contact the carrier to try to find out more information .

( 09 : 27 : 47 PM ) Samantha : Because the meals did not arrive to you on the correct day , when the carrier is able to attempt delivery the meals will no longer be safe to consume . We have reached out to try to have this package stopped , however there is a slight chance it may still arrive . If it does , the meals will need to be disposed of right away .

( 09 : 28 : 01 PM ) Samantha : To further express my apologies , I have issued a full refund in the amount of $ 39 to cover the cost of the meals this week . Refunds may take 3-5 business days to completely process , however this can vary depending on your bank . I &apos;ve also applied a 100 % in-store credit in the amount of $ 59.99 for the inconvenience . This credit will be automatically applied to your next charge with us and will be available for a one time use within the next 6 months .

( 09 : 47 : 59 PM ) Samantha : One moment while I pull up your subscription to look into this for you .

( 09 : 48 : 27 PM ) Samantha : If you would like to change your meal plan for the December 21st order , you are free to do so !

( 09 : 48 : 31 PM ) Samantha : Here is how to change the number of meals you will receive each week :

( 09 : 49 : 40 PM ) Theresa Andersen : When I looked at doing that it said the change would not be effective until January . I only want to change it for this one week simply because you can &apos;t deliver anything on 12 / 28 .

( 09 : 50 : 19 PM ) Samantha : You need to change it when viewing December 21st . There is a green &quot; change &quot; link next to the number of meals you are currently set to receive that week .

( 09 : 50 : 43 PM ) Theresa Andersen : Oh , OK I &apos;ll try that . Thanks !

( 09 : 50 : 54 PM ) Samantha : You &apos;re very welcome , Theresa ! Please let me know if that works for you .

( 09 : 51 : 02 PM ) Theresa Andersen : OK

( 09 : 53 : 58 PM ) Theresa Andersen : All I am seeing is the green change meals button . That allows me to change what meals I am selecting but it won &apos;t let me save anything if I have more than the 6 meals I am set up to get weekly . Is there another place I need to look ?

( 09 : 54 : 41 PM ) Samantha : This option will be near the upper left hand corner of your meal planner .

( 09 : 54 : 58 PM ) Samantha : It should say &quot; 6 meals &quot; and then the change button will be next to it .

( 09 : 55 : 07 PM ) Samantha : I can also make this change for you .

( 09 : 55 : 46 PM ) Theresa Andersen : OK , found it !

( 09 : 55 : 53 PM ) Samantha : That &apos;s great !

( 09 : 55 : 57 PM ) Samantha : Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time ?

( 09 : 56 : 10 PM ) Theresa Andersen : No , that is all I needed . Thanks .

I was disappointed that I didn &apos;t have meals for that week , but I appreciated the way this was made right and wanted to give Freshly another try .

I just received an email that the order I am expecting today may be late also . This is very discouraging . Will I ever be able to get my meals on time ?

( 09 : 52 : 12 PM ) Alondra : You &apos;re welcome .

( 09 : 54 : 15 PM ) Alondra : I do apologize , as there was a delay during transit time and is why your meals did not arrive as scheduled yesterday . Since we only package our meals to withstand 2 full days of transit time and up to 12 hours upon delivery , the meals will no longer be safe to be consumed , as you are in a 2-day zone from us and the meals did not arrive as scheduled .

( 09 : 54 : 58 PM ) Alondra : In light of this , I &apos;ve let our delivery specialist know to reach out to the carrier to have the package destroyed and to also investigate this matter further with the carrier in regards to this matter .

( 09 : 55 : 23 PM ) Alondra : To further express my apologies , I ’ ve gone ahead and issued a full refund in the amount of $ 39 back to your card on file for your Thursday , December 13th order . Please do allow up to 3-5 business days for the funds to post onto your bank account ( depending on your banking institution ) .

( 09 : 55 : 49 PM ) Alondra : I ’ ve also gone ahead and applied an in-house credit in the amount of $ 59.99 onto your subscription for the inconvenience and to honor your first week promo discount from this order . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically be applied towards your next charged order at no additional cost to you .

( 09 : 56 : 19 PM ) Alondra : I also applied an in-house credit in the amount of $ 20.99 onto your subscription to honor your second week promo discount .

( 09 : 56 : 33 PM ) Stephanie Martin : Darn , that &apos;s a bummer about the food . But thank you for checking into it , and refunding me , and offering a credit . I appreciate it .

( 09 : 57 : 31 PM ) Alondra : You &apos;re so welcome and once again , my sincerest apologies , Stephanie and especially for experiencing this on your first order !

( 09 : 58 : 03 PM ) Stephanie Martin : No worries . I suspect that the delivery companies are extra busy this time of year . Thank you , and have a great weekend .

( 09 : 58 : 14 PM ) Alondra : If for some reason the meals to end up arriving today , please do dispose of those meals as they are considered spoiled at this point .

( 09 : 58 : 05 PM ) Kasandra : Right now you &apos;re only going to see a limited number of days for your first delivery due to the availability that demand has caused .

( 09 : 58 : 32 PM ) Kasandra : And also because we only plan out approximately 3 weeks in advance .

( 09 : 58 : 44 PM ) Kat : Hm okay will the first delivery have to be in February though because the only times available were January 11 and 18

( 09 : 59 : 55 PM ) Kasandra : No , not necessarily . The last week and a half or so of January has not been planned out yet , so availability won &apos;t be showing for that yet on the options at sign up .

( 09 : 59 : 44 PM ) Josh : thanks for reaching out !

( 10 : 00 : 33 PM ) Josh : Though we currently do not offer gift cards , you can order a subscription for someone else using your information and set the gift recipient ’ s address as the shipping address on the subscription . This would ensure that you are charged for the subscription , but that the gift recipient is the one who gets the meals .

( 10 : 00 : 36 PM ) Josh : To set up a menu for the first delivery , you &apos;ll want to get the recipients list of desired meals ( or select meals for them , ) then place the order ! We don &apos;t have trial options , so if you want to gift one week only you &apos;ll just need to cancel the subscription after the first order has been shipped . If you &apos;re ordering more than one week , you could share the login details with the recipient so they can make changes to their future orders ! The deadline to cancel or edit meals prior to the second order being charged will also be listed in your Welcome Email ! : - )

( 09 : 57 : 31 PM ) Taylor : Thanks for reaching out to Freshly ! Completing the sign up process agrees to our terms of service , which is a weekly based subscription service .

( 09 : 57 : 51 PM ) Taylor : We don &apos;t have trial options , so if you want to try one week only , you &apos;ll just need to cancel the subscription after the first order has been shipped . The deadline to cancel prior to the second order being charged will also be listed in your Welcome Email !

( 09 : 58 : 22 PM ) Taylor : If you will verify the phone number linked to your subscription , I &apos;ll be glad to take a look to better confirm your weekly deadline .

( 09 : 58 : 46 PM ) Taylor : Thanks ! Just a moment , please .

( 09 : 59 : 46 PM ) Taylor : Thanks so much for your patience , Donna ! I do see that your first order is scheduled to arrive on December 31st . Those meals are set to ship tomorrow so you should be on the look out for a confirmation email sometime tomorrow with a link to the tracking info enclosed .

( 10 : 00 : 28 PM ) Taylor : Based on your default delivery day of Monday , your deadline to make changes to an upcoming order or to skip a week is each Wednesday before 2 pm PT . As long as you edit an order , skip an order or cancel the subscription prior to that deadline each week , we &apos;ll be able to successfully secure the change .

( 10 : 02 : 04 PM ) Donna Webb : Ok . I am very interested in continuing , I would just like to experience the flavor of the meals and the portions to see if is something we would like .

( 10 : 02 : 53 PM ) Taylor : My pleasure ! I totally understand . The deadline for your next order that &apos;s scheduled to arrive on January 7th is Wednesday , January 2nd before 2 pm PT . IS that enough time to decide or would you like to skip that order ?

( 10 : 04 : 18 PM ) Donna Webb : Could I skip that order ?

( 10 : 04 : 49 PM ) Donna Webb : I would assume I would have to select meals for that as well

( 10 : 04 : 50 PM ) Taylor : Sure ! I &apos;ll go ahead and skip that for you now . This way , you shouldn &apos;t expect the next delivery until January 14th and you &apos;ll have time to decide if you &apos;d like to proceed .

( 10 : 05 : 11 PM ) Taylor : You &apos;ll need to edit your meals prior to that deadline each week if you &apos;d like to switch up your selections .

( 10 : 05 : 24 PM ) Taylor : Otherwise , you &apos;ll be sent the same meals as previously authorized .

( 10 : 06 : 12 PM ) Donna Webb : Now to clarify , if I don ’ t select meals they will do it for me or send the same ones as the previous order ?

( 10 : 06 : 21 PM ) Taylor : Exactly !

( 10 : 06 : 44 PM ) Donna Webb : Ok I get it ! Thank u so much . I will look for that email

( 07 : 08 : 13 PM ) Kim Barker : A new customer and am wondering how many meals will be delivered and when

( 07 : 08 : 18 PM ) * * * Adam joined the chat * * *

( 07 : 08 : 25 PM ) Adam : Hi Kim !

( 07 : 08 : 34 PM ) Adam : We are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged ) meals on a weekly basis .

In your subscription , you are able to plan out your menus for up to three weeks in advance .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

( 07 : 08 : 54 PM ) Adam : Freshly currently offers four different meal plans for 4 , 6 , 9 , and 12 meals per week .

( 07 : 09 : 00 PM ) Adam : These are priced at $ 49.99 , $ 59.99 , $ 89.99 , and $ 107.99 , respectively . Your plan of choice will arrive in a single shipment each week .

( 07 : 10 : 03 PM ) Adam : It looks here like you are on the six meal plan , but you can change the number of meals you receive each week !

( 07 : 10 : 17 PM ) Kim Barker : Great so each week I will be able to choose which and hoe many can you help me with my first order

( 07 : 10 : 42 PM ) Kim Barker : I need to make that 3 meals a week

( 07 : 11 : 08 PM ) Adam : Correct ! Your weekly deadline to make changes is Monday at 2 pm PT based on your delivery day of Saturday !

( 07 : 11 : 33 PM ) Kim Barker : Please help me change that now

( 07 : 11 : 50 PM ) Adam : I do apologize , but we do not have a 3 meal plan .

( 07 : 12 : 16 PM ) Kim Barker : How about 4 meal plan

( 07 : 12 : 50 PM ) Adam : We can do a four meal plan moving forward , but because you were already charged for the six meals when you signed up , I wouldn &apos;t be able to change that .

( 07 : 13 : 57 PM ) Adam : I did set the default to 4 moving forward .

( 07 : 14 : 17 PM ) Kim Barker : Ok I could I guess I could freeze 3 meals then just skip the next week

( 07 : 14 : 37 PM ) Adam : Our meals are designed to be refrigerated to preserve their freshness , they are typically good for 4-5 days upon receiving your meals . All the meals have a use by date on the back , found on the nutrition label .

We understand that life happens and you are not always able to eat them right away . Therefore , if freezing is necessary , you can indeed freeze the meals .

( 07 : 14 : 56 PM ) Adam : Do you want me to skip the second week for you ?

( 07 : 15 : 37 PM ) Kim Barker : So maybe keep the 6 day plan then and thrn yes then I would skip the next week plan

( 07 : 15 : 53 PM ) Adam : One moment , while I switch that back for you .

( 07 : 17 : 01 PM ) Adam : I did set the default back to six , and skipped that second week for you !

( 07 : 17 : 20 PM ) Kim Barker : Thanks and hopefully my husband will approve then we will stay with this plan

( 07 : 17 : 37 PM ) Adam : Let &apos;s hope ! They are delicious !

( 07 : 17 : 49 PM ) Adam : Is there anything else I can assist you with , Kim ?

( 07 : 20 : 38 PM ) Adam : Since I have not heard back from you , I am going to bring this chat to a close . If you need further assistance , you can simply start typing away in your chat window to restart the chat .

( 09 : 20 : 37 PM ) * * * Adam joined the chat * * *

( 09 : 20 : 44 PM ) Adam : Hi Jamie !

( 09 : 20 : 57 PM ) Adam : Our meals are designed to be heated in the microwave , since they already arrive fully cooked . If you don ’ t have a microwave or would rather not use one , however , you can certainly use an oven or a range ! Just be aware that you will have to get a few pots and pans dirty , since you cannot use our containers in an oven or on a range . Please also note that heating in an oven or a pot will require you to watch the item closely to see when it has reached your desired temperature .

( 09 : 21 : 33 PM ) Jamie Golden : What kind of container is used .

( 09 : 21 : 58 PM ) Adam : They are in a BPA-Free recyclable container .

( 09 : 22 : 12 PM ) Jamie Golden : Ok . Thank you

( 09 : 22 : 45 PM ) Jamie Golden : Do you think they ’ d be appropriate for a stream oven ?

( 09 : 23 : 16 PM ) Adam : I would assume so , I would transfer them into an oven-safe dish prior !

Hello Robin !

I hope you ’ re having a great week ! I saw you canceled your subscription recently because you weren ’ t happy with the meals ... I ’ m so sorry to hear this !

I just wanted to let you know that we add a new meal to the menu every week so there ’ s always something new to try . In fact , we &apos;ve added some great meals recently , like Butternut Squash Risotto , Sausage Baked Penne , and Lebanese-Style Beef Meatballs .

If any of those sound good to you , we ’ d love to have you come back and get $ 10 off your next order . Just reactivate your subscription by clicking here , go to &quot; Subscription Settings &quot; , and add the code freshconnect489453 to your subscription !

Sent from my iPhoneHello Debra !

Thanks for reaching out to us !

I &apos;m very sorry for any confusion .

I see that your subscription is cancelled , but not your first order set for January 12th . We would have to be notified directly about cancelling your order once it &apos;s been charged . However , I have taken care of this for you now !

I &apos;ve gone ahead and cancelled the order , and I &apos;ve issued a full refund back to your card in the amount of $ 59.99 to cover the cost of the meals that were charged . This should process in 3-5 business days depending on who you bank with ! The funds will be posted back to your PayPal account .

Just as a friendly reminder , we are a weekly based subscription service . This means you &apos;ll have an automatic charge and shipment of meals each week . Although you do have the option to skip weeks , if you don &apos;t want to receive meals weekly . If you would like to reactivate your subscription to receive meals from us , you can do so by using this helpful link :


How do I reactivate my subscription ?



I hope this helps , Debra , and if you should need anything further , please reach out , as I &apos;m always happy to help !

I did speak with Fedex directly today , to verify whether they could get your order out , to deliver on time . I &apos;m very sorry , but your order was in fact delayed . I &apos;ve already refunded you in full for the order , and you will receive a separate email confirmation . In light of the inconvenience , I &apos;ve also added a full one week credit of your 4 Meal Plan . That in-house credit for , $ 49.99 , will automatically apply to your next billed order .

Since you are in a one day zone , if there is a delay in the future , they will be able to try and reattempt delivery on Saturday as well . I know that doesn &apos;t get you yummy meals this week , but I hope it will help in the future .

I apologize for any confusion ! The promo that you &apos;ve taken a screen shot of is our promo for our 6 meal plan . The promo gives you 6 meals per week for your first initial 2 weeks . Each week would have a $ 20 discount for your first initial 2 weeks . This means that would be a total of $ 40 in savings .

Thank you for reaching out to us !

I have gone through and taken a look and see that there is only 1 charge for a single order . Is it possible that there is an additional subscription under a different email address or phone number ? Would you also be able to see if the name / address is correct outside the box for both orders ? Also , there will be an invoice inside the packages , would those have you name as well ? I can definitely begin to further investigate once I receive this information .

I look forward to your response Cathy !

Thank you for responding !

I have gone through and taken a look at your son &apos;s subscription and it does not appear that he sent that second package . I sincerely apologize there , Cathy . I believe there may have been an extra delivery that possibly was not packaged correctly , and because of this , you received two sets of orders instead of the 1 that was intended to be delivered .

Thank you so much for your patience and help through all of this Cathy ! I sincerely appreciate it as we definitely would want to prevent this from occurring in the future ! I would also possibly check the meals use-by date , just to ensure that it wasn &apos;t possibly a late order . The invoice itself may be the best piece of help here , as that would indicate if it was incorrect packaging . I also , don &apos;t see an extra charge for an extra order .

I look forward to any further assistance Cathy ! We will definitely try to get to the bottom of this !

Dear Cswppl ,

We &apos;ve been advised by our delivery partner that your order may not have reached you yesterday as planned . Due to technical issues on their end , we don &apos;t currently have accurate tracking info .

If your meals arrive today , they will have been unrefrigerated for an amount of time that makes them unsafe to eat . Your health is our top priority , and we &apos;ll no longer be able to guarantee the freshness of your order , even if the meals still feel cold . Rest assured you &apos;ll be fully compensated for your order if this occurs .

Thank you for taking the time to get back in touch !

I &apos;ve been back in touch with our team here , and we are currently looking into the possibility of getting a replacement order to you . While I couldn &apos;t guarantee it would be possible at this point , we &apos;ll check out every option we have available .

Customer Care SpecialistRe : Is is possible to stop by your store and purchase a meal for trial ? I do not want to give a gift that will not help a family member who is recovering from an illness . Thank you .
B. JohnsonHello B Johnson ,

Thank you for reaching out to us and for your interest in Freshly !

I do apologize , as we do not have a store and everything has to be done through our Freshly website in regards to the sign up process and making meal changes , skipping weeks or cancelling the subscription .

Though we currently do not offer gift cards , you can order a subscription for someone else using your information and set the gift recipient ’ s address as the shipping address on the subscription . This would ensure that you are charged for the subscription , but that the gift recipient is the one who gets the meals .

To set up a menu for the first delivery , you &apos;ll want to get the recipients list of desired meals ( or select meals for them , ) then place the order ! We don &apos;t have trial options , so if you want to gift one week only you &apos;ll just need to cancel the subscription after the first order has been shipped . If you &apos;re ordering more than one week , you could share the login details with the recipient so they can make changes to their future orders ! The deadline to cancel or edit meals prior to the second order being charged will also be listed in your Welcome Email !

We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help you manage a subscription if you decide you &apos;d like to give us a try :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


I hope this helps , B Johnson , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

Customer Care SpecialistHello ,

I recently sent an order , but cancelled same day . I ordered this as a gift for my Grandmother , but she was not happy with the meal options . I saw my card was charged for the initial order # 9499082 . Please confirm my card will be refunded and that no meals will be sent .



Thank you ,


KristinHello there Kristin ,

I am so sorry to hear that we were just not a good fit for you , but I would be more than happy to assist with your request !

Now , as you requested , I have gone ahead and canceled the shipment for Thursday , January 10th . As well as making sure to fully refund you for this order , so please do expect back $ 59.99 in approximately 3 to 5 business days . You should also automatically receive an email confirmation of that refund .

While I &apos;m certainly sorry to see you go , I hope you will consider joining us again in the near future . We have lots of new and exciting changes and many more delicious meals on the horizon !

How do I reactivate my subscription ?

I hope this helps Kristin , and if you should need anything further , please reach out , as I &apos;m always happy to help !

Have a wonderful rest of your day !

It is 12 / 14 at 3 : 53pm and I just got home to my current Freshly order . When I opened the package the meals were thawed out . See the pictures below . Even if the
package was outside it is 35 degrees here in Alsip . The package should ’ ve been good for some time if I got home late . Not sure how long the package has been there . I ’ m not sure if I should eat this order this week .

UnsubscribeHello Victor ,

Thank you for taking the time to get in touch !

While the meals there are indeed thawed , your meals are not meant to be frozen , as we ship them cool , fresh , and refrigerated straight to you . The meals are meant to be good for up to 12 hours on your doorstep after delivery , so you won &apos;t need to worry about the delivery timing in this case . As they aren &apos;t frozen at any point during their trip to you normally , they should indeed be cool , but not frozen . However , if they are warm , instead of cool , on delivery , please do let us know here , as that would be highly unusual !

It sounds like your meals should be good to go , Victor , but if there &apos;s anything warm or unusual about them you &apos;d like to go over here , please let me know ! I &apos;ll be glad to look into it further here , as well .



Fresh wishes ,

UnsubscribeHello Justin ,

Thank you so much for reaching out to us , and for your interest in Freshly !

The meals do no come frozen . We deliver our meals to come cool to the touch ! The meals themselves are prepared about a day before they are cooked , once prepared the meals are then cooked and packaged to be delivered the next day ! From there , the meals go out and are delivered to your doorstep ! In total , the process is about 2 days from when they are prepared !

We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help you manage a subscription if you decide you &apos;d like to give us a try :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


I hope this helps , Justin , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

Thank you for reaching out to us today .

I am so very sorry for any inconvenience , however , the deadline time has changed to 2pm PT for all deadline days .

( 10 : 02 : 53 PM ) * * * Taylor L. joined the chat * * *

( 10 : 03 : 01 PM ) Taylor L. : Hello Brtiney , thanks for reaching out !

( 10 : 03 : 16 PM ) Taylor L. : We don ’ t have the ability to change the ingredients of the meals you see on our website because of the huge number of meals we cook every week - over 100,000 ! To allow for this , we prepare all our meals in batches and therefore can ’ t customize recipes for individual dishes .

( 10 : 03 : 23 PM ) Taylor L. : The only item you can add or not-add to food would be cheese , which can be added or removed for a few select dishes . You can use the dietary filter on our site , however , if you want to see certain meals that lack an ingredient that you would rather avoid .

( 10 : 03 : 41 PM ) Taylor L. : I believe currently the only meal on our menu you can remove the cheese from is the Three Bean Ancho Chili .

( 10 : 04 : 20 PM ) Britney : Okay . Thank you

( 10 : 04 : 39 PM ) Britney : does it automatically charge you each week or do you have to sign in and purchase each week

( 10 : 04 : 52 PM ) Taylor L. : We are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week !

( 10 : 05 : 41 PM ) Britney : do you have any idea how much cheese is included ? I just mean if you look at the dishes in the pictures it seems it is very light

( 10 : 06 : 16 PM ) Britney : is the menu that I see now always the menu or does it change each week ?

( 10 : 06 : 22 PM ) Taylor L. : That &apos;s a really good question ! Let me see if I can find some information on that .

( 10 : 06 : 43 PM ) Taylor L. : We try to add one new meal to our menu each week and rotate out a meal as well .

( 10 : 06 : 54 PM ) Britney : okay thanks

( 10 : 07 : 49 PM ) Taylor L. : I &apos;m not finding much on the exact cheese content for our meals , but I &apos;m personally lactose intolerant and most of our meals don &apos;t bother me at all . I believe our penne meals contain some of the most cheese .

( 10 : 09 : 03 PM ) Britney : Okay thank you !

( 10 : 09 : 09 PM ) Britney : I am intolerant not allergic

( 10 : 09 : 23 PM ) Britney : so I ’ m just wondering if I might could tolerate or pick it out maybe

( 10 : 09 : 26 PM ) Britney : thanks for your help

I hope this message finds you well !

I am so sorry to tell you that due to an unexpected technical error , the meals for your December 18th delivery were not successfully updated in our system . At this point , the meals have entered production so we are unable to try and make those changes again .

To try and make up for the trouble , I have added an in-store credit in the amount of $ 59.99 to your subscription to cover the cost of your next order charge for 6 meals . This one-time use credit will be automatically applied to your next charged order and will remain available on your subscription until use , up to 6 months .

I can confirm that your meal change requests were successfully made for your January 8th order , so you are set to receive the desired meals that day !

I am so sorry , again , for any inconvenience , Michael , and I do very much appreciate your patience and understanding ! If there is anything at all that I can do to further assist , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

Thank you so much for your time , and I hope you have a wonderful rest of your night !




Fresh wishes ,
Amy R.

( 10 : 17 : 06 PM ) Taylor L. : Give me just a moment to look into this for you . 😊

( 10 : 17 : 50 PM ) Rebecca Million : Thank you . Right now they are delivered on Thursdays which means they have to be eaten by Monday so it doesn ’ t help me through my work week . 🤷 ♀ ️

( 10 : 18 : 19 PM ) Taylor L. : It looks like we deliver to your area Wednesday through Saturday !

( 10 : 18 : 26 PM ) Taylor L. : The meals that we send to customers have a use-by date of about 4 days after they are delivered - although the shelf life could vary slightly in some cases . You can check the “ use by ” date on a meal ’ s cardboard sleeve for more specifics regarding that meal itself . We do the best we can to ensure the freshness of our meals by packaging them securely and ensuring they are nice and cool during the shipping process .

( 10 : 18 : 35 PM ) Taylor L. : While our meals are designed to be refrigerated to preserve their freshness , but we understand that life happens and you are not always able to eat them right away . Therefore , if freezing is necessary , you can indeed freeze the meals . If you do go the freezing route , please follow these heating instructions : 1 . Do not defrost . 2 . Microwave for 1 min from frozen state . 3 . Follow original heating instructions provided .

( 10 : 19 : 33 PM ) Rebecca Million : Okay so just freeze them ? ! I didn ’ t think you could

( 10 : 20 : 14 PM ) Taylor L. : You definitely can ! We usually don &apos;t recommend it as they lose a little bit of their freshness ( which is of course what we pride ourselves on ) but we definitely understand that 4 days isn &apos;t a lot of time if you don &apos;t have someone helping you eat the meals !

( 10 : 35 : 20 PM ) Alondra : I do apologize , as I see that when you had changed your default meal plan in your subscription settings , it is a two-step process and would advise you to also change the amount of meals from 12 meals to 4 meals to each of your upcoming orders in your meal planner at the time of change . I see that you were charged for 12 meals for your Wednesday , December 19th order , I am not able to change the amount of meals to 4 meals . However , I am able to go ahead and apply a credit for the price difference from the 12 meal and 4 meal plan of your Wednesday , December 19th order.Chat started : 2018-12-14 10 : 26 PM UTC

( 10 : 42 : 04 PM ) Randy Mullis : Another question : why can &apos;t we plan further out ? As of now , I have no idea what will be available the week after New Years . It would just be helpful to be able to plan .

( 10 : 42 : 45 PM ) Randy Mullis : When I had Home Chef and other services like it , I knew what was offered more than a month away .

( 10 : 43 : 14 PM ) Russell : Ah , gotcha !

( 10 : 43 : 42 PM ) Russell : I can certainly note your feedback for the web design team but , for now , the Meal Planner only shows future order as far ahead as 3 weeks .

( 10 : 43 : 51 PM ) Russell : I &apos;m sorry for any resulting inconvenience .

( 10 : 44 : 01 PM ) Russell : Did you see Eric &apos;s reply earlier about the 2 holiday weeks ?

( 10 : 44 : 18 PM ) Randy Mullis : Plus , it is inconvenient to get my meals on one day and then have to hurry up and make any changes in less than 24 hours , if I decide I don &apos;t care for a particular meal , etc .

( 10 : 44 : 36 PM ) Randy Mullis : Yep , I saw his comment about the holiday schedule .

( 10 : 44 : 55 PM ) Russell : OK , gotcha .

( 10 : 45 : 09 PM ) Russell : I hear you loud &amp; amp ; clear since I also rely on weekly Freshly meals .

( 10 : 45 : 50 PM ) Randy Mullis : Everything we have tried is really good . We are surprised we haven &apos;t had to add and lot of salt and pepper to make them palatable !

( 10 : 46 : 31 PM ) Randy Mullis : Can you tell me how many weeks we have the special $ 39 for 6 meals ? My husband Randy set it up and I didn &apos;t get details .

( 10 : 46 : 40 PM ) Russell : Duly noted as well ! Thanks for the kind feedback !

( 10 : 47 : 14 PM ) Russell : What &apos;s your phone no. so I can check ?

( 10 : 47 : 37 PM ) Randy Mullis : 478-256-3092 cell , or he may have used 478-935-8216 home .

( 10 : 51 : 08 PM ) Russell : Thanks ! Let me check !

( 10 : 52 : 22 PM ) Russell : OK , you have a 2-week promo .

( 10 : 52 : 35 PM ) Russell : It applied already to Dec. 14th and Dec. 7th orders .

( 10 : 53 : 07 PM ) Russell : Your next order then , Dec. 20th , was charged $ 59.99 , the regular price .

( 10 : 54 : 02 PM ) Russell : Do you want Thu. delivery or Fri . ?

( 10 : 54 : 15 PM ) Russell : I see 2 different delivery days here when I was reviewing your subscription .

( 10 : 55 : 05 PM ) Russell : All yours will be on Thu. going forward , by the way .

( 10 : 55 : 13 PM ) Randy Mullis : He originally set it up for Friday , then we backed it up to Thursday for the future orders .

( 10 : 55 : 22 PM ) Russell : This means your deadline to make changes is the preceding Friday before 5 p.m . EST / 2 p.m . PT .

( 10 : 55 : 31 PM ) Russell : OK , thanks for confirming ! I see that here , too .

( 10 : 55 : 38 PM ) Russell : Please let me know if I can assist you with anything further ! I &apos;d also appreciate your taking our quick survey about your experience once the chat is over .

( 10 : 57 : 24 PM ) * * * Russell left the chat * * * ( 10 : 57 : 46 PM ) Randy Mullis : Like I mentioned , that is kinda inconvenient . We have to race to try whatever new meal ( s ) we may have gotten Thursday so we can make changes to the next week &apos;s order . It would be really great to get at least 2 days . So if I get my order on Thursday ( which is usually after 3pm ) , I would have until maybe 8pm on Saturday .

( 10 : 59 : 12 PM ) Breana : My sincerest apologies ! I will get with him and speak to him about that issue .

( 11 : 00 : 14 PM ) Randy Mullis : Geez , I am offering a suggestion to make ordering a little easier . We really like the food , but don &apos;t want to get stuck with same food each week because we don &apos;t get a chance to switch out our menu .

( 11 : 01 : 34 PM ) Randy Mullis : Anyway , how long do y &apos;all keep the same meal offerings ? Do you change the entire selection after a month ? Do you stagger when / how many you switch ?

( 11 : 02 : 19 PM ) Breana : I am so very sorry !

( 11 : 02 : 30 PM ) Breana : Can you please verify the phone number associated with the subscription ?

( 11 : 03 : 01 PM ) Breana : We try to change 1 to 2 meals every week ! Unless , of course we have a holiday .

( 11 : 03 : 22 PM ) Randy Mullis : 478-256-3092 or 478-935-8216 . My husband , Randy , set up the subscription for me so I don &apos;t know which number he used

( 11 : 03 : 57 PM ) Breana : Not a problem ! Thank you for that information .

( 11 : 04 : 34 PM ) Randy Mullis : He is out of town 5 nights a week , and he set it up so I eat decent meals and not get take out or eat a bowl of cereal for supper. lol

( 11 : 05 : 49 PM ) Breana : I definitely understand ! I am so sorry for any troubles or confusion . It looks like your weekly deadline is every Friday before 2 pm PT , and will only change if you alter your delivery date . However , you can change your meals prior to this day . Our system will only show 3-4 weeks in advance . It is a bit confusing due to the holidays . However , I can assure that after the holidays this is a week to week basis and works very smoothly .

( 11 : 06 : 20 PM ) Breana : Nonetheless , I have submitted your feedback to the correct party .

( 11 : 07 : 18 PM ) Randy Mullis : Thanks for passing along my comments . I do hope it gets smoother after the holidays because I will likely increase the number of meals I get each week .

( 10 : 47 : 15 PM ) Kailey : Okay Sairam ! I ’ m happy to let you know that despite the weekly deadline passing for this order , I was able to get this order stopped for you , so you ’ re all set with that . Since you had already been charged for the order , I &apos;ve gone ahead and added a 100 % discount to your subscription , so that you automatically won &apos;t be charged for your next 6 meal order . This discount will expire if not used within 6 months . For the future , your deadline for editing or skipping any orders before they begin production is every Friday before 2 PM PST . This will only change if your location , or default delivery day changes .

UnsubscribeHello Castlehillcouple ,

Thank you so much for reaching out to us , and for your interest in Freshly !

Our kitchen that prepares your meals would actually depend on where you reside . Our kitchen in MD would prepare meals for most of the east coast area , while our Arizona kitchen prepares meals for most of our west coast customers . If you provide your zip code to me , I will be more than happy to look into delivery details for your area ! Our packaging is designed to keep meals safe in transit for up to 2 days while in transit , and 12 hours at your doorstep . We always ensure to ship from the facility that would ensure a safe arrival of our Freshly meals .

I would love to take this time to tell you more about Freshly , Castlehillcouple ! We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help you manage a subscription if you decide you &apos;d like to give us a try :

Subject : Re : Re : Nice to meet you ! Hello Castlehillcouple ,

Thank you for your response !

According to my research , your meals would be prepared and cooked in our Savage , Maryland kitchen . We are able to deliver to you on Tuesdays- Saturdays . Based on availability with all of new recent sign ups , if you join today , your first delivery could be as early as , Tuesday , January 22nd . With regular weekly deliveries following , unless you decide to skip , or cancel of course .

Our meals certainly do help make life tastier and easier ! Since we don ’ t use artificial or chemical preservatives , the meals have a refrigerated shelf life of about 4 – 5 days . Every meal has a “ use by ” date on the back nutrition label .

Even though our meals taste best when eaten fresh , you can freeze them if you can ’ t get to them by their “ use by ” date . You simply need to add a couple of minutes to the heating time and reheat from frozen , without thawing . We recommend confirming that the food is reheated to 165 degrees , the same as reheating from fresh !

I hope this helps , Castlehillcouple !

If you have additional questions , please don &apos;t hesitate to reach out . I am always happy to help .

I truly hope you enjoy the meals !

Thank you for your reply !

Just so that you are aware , in order to help you find what you ’ re looking for , we launched a sort tool on the “ change meals ” page where you can sort by nutritional attributes and find meals that meet your specific needs . I have provided a link below to assist you with sorting options .

How do I sort the menu by nutritional values ?

Also , you will notice a &quot; Filter &quot; tool as well , which is located next to the , &quot; Sort &quot; tool in your Meal Planner , when editing meals for any particular week . This tool will allow you to filter out ingredients you try to avoid , such as diary , or pork .

If you have nutrition / ingredient-related question _ ( s ) you can always have them best answered by one of our Wellness Experts ; they have educational backgrounds in nutrition and will be able to answer your question _ ( s ) more thoroughly . With dietary needs and preferences , especially concerning medical needs , we want to be sure you have the best information we can provide !

If you would be open to speaking with one of these Freshly Wellness Experts , you can easily schedule a call using this link : https : / / calendly.com / freshlywellness

If you ever need assistance , you know where to find me !

Have a wonderful weekend , Castlehillcouple !

Thank you for reaching out to us !

My apologies for any inconvenience , but I can certainly assist ! I do see that your very first delivery is scheduled to reach you on Friday , January 18 . I &apos;m so very sorry to say that if you cancel the subscription right now , then that delivery would also be automatically cancelled by our system . If you only want 1 delivery , then you are certainly able to cancel the subscription when that first delivery ships out to you . We will send you an email on the day that your delivery will be ships . I do see that you have skipped the 2nd delivery for Friday , January 25 . You can certainly skip any deliveries that you see in your Meal Planner , so that you don &apos;t receive anything after Friday , January 18 , until you are ready to cancel .

Included below is a super helpful link with information on how you can cancel your subscription . I truly hope this information helps !

How do I cancel a subscription ?

Nicole , please let me know if you have any questions or if I may be of any further assistance . Have a great day !

Our online menu does list the full nutritional information for each one of our meals along with the serving size for each meal ! You would simply click on a specific meal in our menu in order to bring up that meal &apos;s information .

Freshly currently offers the following meal plans :

4 meals / week for $ 49.99 / week
6 meals / week for $ 59.99 / week
9 meals / week for $ 89.99 / week
12 meals / week for $ 107.99 / week


If you would like to receive more than 12 meals per week then you are certainly able to create more than 1 subscription . I hope this information helps !

I would like to share some additional information with you regarding Freshly . We are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week !

Kim , please let me know if you have any questions or if I may be of any further assistance . Have a great day !

( 03 : 02 : 08 AM ) Reuben Adams : How do I keep 6 meals fresh , I &apos;ll only want 2 or 3 per week ? Can I freeze them , and wait a month to reorder .

( 03 : 02 : 10 AM ) * * * Taylor L. joined the chat * * *

( 03 : 02 : 17 AM ) Taylor L. : Hello Reuben , thanks for reaching out !

( 03 : 02 : 24 AM ) Taylor L. : Our meals are designed to be refrigerated to preserve their freshness , but we understand that life happens and you are not always able to eat them right away . Therefore , if freezing is necessary , you can indeed freeze the meals . If you do go the freezing route , please follow these heating instructions : 1 . Do not defrost . 2 . Microwave for 1 min from frozen state . 3 . Follow original heating instructions provided .

( 03 : 02 : 40 AM ) Taylor L. : We do also offer a 4 meal plan !

( 03 : 04 : 04 AM ) Reuben Adams : Can I try the 4 meal plan just once to see if I like it ?

( 03 : 04 : 35 AM ) Taylor L. : We don &apos;t currently offer a trial period but you can create a subscription and cancel after receiving your first order . You &apos;d just have to do so by your deadline to ensure we don &apos;t charge you for another order .

( 03 : 04 : 44 AM ) Taylor L. : We are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week .

( 03 : 07 : 19 AM ) Taylor L. : Were there any other questions I could help answer tonight , Reuben ?

( 03 : 07 : 35 AM ) Reuben Adams : Where do I find the 4 week plan on the site ? I &apos;ll have to back out of the 6 meal plan .

( 03 : 08 : 03 AM ) Taylor L. : Are you signing up with a promotional offer ?

( 03 : 08 : 09 AM ) Taylor L. : It could be that offer is only valid for our 6 meal plan .

( 03 : 09 : 29 AM ) Reuben Adams : I is $ 59.99 with free shipping for 6 meals . Probably promo offer .

( 03 : 09 : 39 AM ) Taylor L. : That &apos;s actually our standard offer !

( 03 : 09 : 49 AM ) Taylor L. : We never charge shipping for any of our meal plans .

( 03 : 10 : 02 AM ) Taylor L. : You should be able to go back or simply restart sign up and select the 4 meal plan .

( 03 : 10 : 17 AM ) Reuben Adams : Thanks Taylor

( 03 : 10 : 32 AM ) Taylor L. : My pleasure , Reuben !

( 03 : 10 : 34 AM ) Taylor L. : Is there anything else I can assist you with ? During the Thanksgiving holiday , and now Christmas and New Years week , we were unable to order our meals due to no delivery in our area . Why is this ? We are still counting on our meals during our holidays , we love the food , and we are at the age that the holidays do not include huge family meals . We love freshly &apos;s food , service , and cost . However , not being able to order a delivery for every week is not what we were expecting with this service . Thank you ! Diane MillerHello Diane ,

Thank you for reaching out to us ! I &apos;m so sorry for the disappointment !

Our production and kitchen were closed on certain days so our Freshly team could enjoy the holidays with their loved ones . We tried to limit how many customers wouldn &apos;t receive meals because of this , and I &apos;m truly sorry you were one of them . While we don &apos;t have sooner days open for delivery , you will , however , resume delivery on Friday , January 11th !

I hope this helps , Diane , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

Customer Care SpecialistHi

Sent from my iPadHi ,

We ordered this service for my grandparents and they will be out of town the week of the 11th ( of Jan ) is there anyway to either cancel this order or to change the date to a different address , either in KC or in the Orlando area ?

Thanks I appreciate the help in advance

MaraleeHello Maralee ,

Thanks for reaching out to us today !

We do still have time to change that address on our end if you &apos;d like to do so ! Please just send us the address you &apos;d like that first delivery to go to and we &apos;ll be happy to make that change for you .

Here &apos;s also a helpful guide on how to change the delivery address on any future orders for your future reference !

How do I change my delivery address ?

Just as a friendly FYI , ( or reminder if you already knew ! ) we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Friday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Sunday before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


These are just a few of the really helpful links in our FAQ . You can always access even more information from our FAQ page by clicking on the &quot; Help &quot; tab in the upper right hand corner while logged into your account ! And of course , we are always happy to assist via email , text or phone at 844-FRESHLY or via chat ! Our current hours of operation are from 6am-11pm PT every day .

I hope this helps , Maralee , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

( 10 : 53 : 14 PM ) Christe : How do I set up Freshly as a gift ?

I would like to let the person who gets the gift pick out her meals but I would like to pay

( 10 : 53 : 22 PM ) KB : Hello !

( 10 : 53 : 33 PM ) Christe : Hello

( 10 : 53 : 36 PM ) KB : Good question , Christe !

( 10 : 53 : 42 PM ) KB : While we don ’ t currently offer gift cards , you can definitely send a weekly subscription as a gift .

( 10 : 53 : 44 PM ) KB : Under your personal account , you can add a subscription that uses your billing info for payment and your gift recipient ’ s address for shipping . That way , you ’ re charged but your lucky friend gets the meals .

( 10 : 53 : 47 PM ) KB : If you ’ re signing up your friend for a subscription , and you only want to gift one week , you &apos;ll just need to cancel the subscription after the first order has been shipped . The deadline to cancel or skip weeks will be outlined in your Meal Planner and your Welcome email .

( 10 : 54 : 04 PM ) KB : To let her pick her meals , simply give her the sign-in info .

( 10 : 54 : 06 PM ) KB : Is there anything else I can assist you with ?

( 10 : 55 : 02 PM ) Christe : that makes sense . I will set up the account and billing and let her choose. thanks , I will just start the subscription later in the month so she has time to look it over

( 10 : 55 : 10 PM ) KB : Indeed !

( 10 : 55 : 13 PM ) KB : Is there anything else I can assist you with ?

( 10 : 55 : 33 PM ) Christe : No thank you . That was it . Have a good evening

( 10 : 31 : 29 PM ) Kim Ewing : Does that mean I can only send my order to a different address once or may I send my meals to a different address periodically ?

( 10 : 32 : 33 PM ) Stephen : In the meal planner , we provide up to 3 weeks ahead to view and edit !

( 10 : 32 : 49 PM ) Stephen : You would be able to adjust the individual shipping address for the 3 orders that are available to edit !

( 10 : 33 : 04 PM ) Kim Ewing : Ok , thank you .

( 11 : 19 : 39 PM ) Jamie : That way you get a little variety but also can enjoy your favorites too .

( 11 : 20 : 20 PM ) Jamie : Each of the new meals will have a little blue ribbon on the meal image indicating it &apos;s new .

( 11 : 20 : 20 PM ) Jaimie : Ok thanks . I don &apos;t eat a lot of meat so then there aren &apos;t too many options weekly ?

( 11 : 44 : 09 PM ) KB : I see !

( 11 : 44 : 12 PM ) KB : One moment while I pull up your subscription to look into this for you !

( 11 : 45 : 26 PM ) KB : Fixed !

( 11 : 45 : 28 PM ) william gottlieb : also , how long can the meals be kept in the refrigerator ?

( 11 : 45 : 31 PM ) william gottlieb : thank you

( 11 : 45 : 35 PM ) KB : Ah .

( 11 : 45 : 49 PM ) KB : Since we don ’ t use artificial or chemical preservatives , the meals have a refrigerated shelf life of about 4 – 5 days . Every meal has a “ use by ” date on the back nutrition label .

( 11 : 45 : 51 PM ) KB : Even though our meals taste best when eaten fresh , you can freeze them if you can ’ t get to them by their “ use by ” date . You simply need to add a couple of minutes to the heating time and reheat from frozen , without thawing . We recommend confirming that the food is reheated to 165 degrees , the same as reheating from fresh !

As another reminder , you can always skip or edit an order by your weekly deadline and charge date of Saturday by 2 PM PT .

Important info about a meal in your order .










Hi Suzanne ,



Based on recent customer feedback , we made a change to the Rustic Chicken meal you have in an upcoming delivery . For all orders starting the week of January 6th , the meal will now come with mashed potatoes instead of polenta cake . As a reminder , please read labels carefully if you have any dietary restrictions .

Thank you for reaching out , and I am so sorry to hear you &apos;ve been experiencing trouble with your meal planner ! I &apos;d be happy to assist here .

To change your meals , you &apos;ll want to select the week you want to edit from your Meal Planner and then select &apos; Change Meals &apos; . From there , you should be able to select the meals you want for the week and select &apos; Save &apos; at the bottom right corner . If there are not enough meals or too many meals selected ( based on your meal plan ) , the system will not let you save your choices . I &apos;ve included a few helpful link below to guide you with changing your meals and your meal plan :

How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?

How do I change the number of meals in my plan ?

If you are having trouble with the device you are using to access your subscription , I &apos;d be happy to make these changes on my end for you ! Which meals did you wish to order for these next two orders ?

Just as a friendly FYI , ( or reminder if you already knew ! ) we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis .

It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any payments or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline . Based on your chosen delivery day of Wednesday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Thursday before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Thank you for your response , and I &apos;m so sorry for the trouble !

What device are you using to access your subscription ? From my experience , using a desktop computer or the iPhone App is the easiest way to change your meals . Mobile websites and tablets / iPads can make accessing certain features of the site a little more complicated at times . I always recommend using a desktop or laptop computer if you are having trouble accessing your subscription .

If you would like , you can reply with the meals you would like to order and I can make these changes on my end . I &apos;m more than happy to assist ! Please let me know if you have any other questions or would like further assistance , Suzanne . I &apos;m happy to help !

Thanks for your reply ! I do apologize for any confusion , however our service is indeed a weekly subscription by default . This is outlined on our website , in our checkout process , and emails , so I do sincerely apologize if any of these details were missed .

Because your first order is still a bit far out , I could not cancel your subscription now , as this would cancel the first order . However , I have made a note in your subscription for your service to be cancelled after you receive your Wednesday , January 9th order , so that you receive nothing else after that unless you were to reactivate your subscription .

I do hope this information helps , Lee ! Again , my sincerest apologies for the confusion !

Thanks for reaching out to us !

I &apos;m very sorry for any confusion . I believe we would be able to deliver to your home . You can provide any specific directions for the driver in your delivery address .

Customer Care SpecialistHow do you deliver ? Do you have your own delivery service or is it through major mailing companies ? Im not sure i can get you through the gate just by giving delivery instructionsHello Patch !

Thanks for your reply !

I &apos;m very sorry for any confusion , and I completely understand your concerns . We use third-party carriers to deliver to your home , either FedEx or OnTrac . We design our meals to withstand 2 days of transit time , and up to 12 hours on your doorstep . The meals are packaged with non-toxic gel ice packs , so they are nice and cool to the touch when they arrive !

I hope this helps , Patch . If you have any additional questions , please let me know !



Fresh wishes ,

Customer Care SpecialistAwesome ! FedEx has access to base , that im sure of . Not sure about OnTrac though.Hello Patch ,

Thank you for your response !

Victoria , is out of the office at the moment , however , I &apos;d be more than happy to assist you further !

The carrier for your area will depend on your zip code and the day that you choose as your default delivery day to receive your meals on . We service your area Monday &apos;s through Saturday &apos;s and if you were to choose between Monday through Friday as your default delivery day then your carrier will be OnTrac . If you were to choose Saturday &apos;s as your default delivery day then FedEx will be your carrier .

Please do reach back out if you should need further assistance , as I &apos;d be more than happy to help !

Customer Care SpecialistCould you please tell me how many carbs and sodium are in the Steak peppercorn and other meals . I am diabetic and both my husband and I have high blood pressure . We tried another food shipped to us like Freshly , but the sodium was sky high and the carbs were also .
Please let me know . Thank you , swdearing @ gmail.com

Happy New YearHello Sherron ,

Thank you for reaching out to us !

Great question ! Our sodium in our meals is a combo of sodium that ’ s naturally occurring in the ingredients themselves ( a medium carrot has about 50 mg of sodium alone ! ) , and a mineral-dense sea salt that we use to season our meals .

Now , for carbs , the average day Freshly meal is about 40 grams , with meals as low as 16 grams .

In order to help you find what you ’ re looking for , we launched a sort tool on the “ choose meals ” page where you can sort by nutritional attributes and find exactly what you ’ re looking for . Our meals also have badges on them that indicate if they are paleo-friendly , vegetarian , soy-free , dairy-free , fewer than 500 calories and 35 grams of carbs , or contain high-protein ingredients .

We don &apos;t have meals that are specifically made for diabetics , but we do focus on low-glycemic carbs and never use refined sugars . Because of that , we do have quite a few diabetic customers that order from us . However , if you have any pre-existing medical conditions , we do recommend that you work with your doctor or nutritionist to determine what meals are right for you and if they fit your dietary needs .

That brings me to my next suggestion ! I ’ d love to connect you with our Wellness Expert , who would be happy to help guide you through our menu , address any questions and feedback , and hopefully , find some meals that would be a great fit for you !

If that would be helpful , you can easily schedule a call using this link : https : / / calendly.com / freshlywellness

I hope this helps Sherron , and if you should need anything further , please reach out , as I &apos;m always happy to help !

UnsubscribeHi Sherry ,

Thanks for reaching out !

I do apologize for any trouble ! Freshly is currently a weekly subscription service by default , however we do offer customers the ability to skip weeks they do not want meals for , as well as cancel and reactivate at a later date . Upon signing up , you &apos;d be given a weekly deadline that would be your cut off for skipping weeks or cancelling , so you know exactly when to take these actions by .

I hope these details make our service a little bit clearer , and do reach out if you have any more questions or concerns . If you &apos;re still not interested , we totally understand , and appreciate you checking us out !

Have a wonderful day , Sherry !

Blessings ,
WandaHi there Wanda ,

Thank you for reaching out to us !

I &apos;m so very sorry to say that we don &apos;t design our meals to comply with any specific medical diets ( like high blood pressure , heart healthy , or others ) . If you have a specific medical need or nutritional goal , we always recommend that you check with your physician or nutritionist to determine if our meals are right for you ! All of our meals are 100 % gluten-free . Our meals are also free of refined sugars and artificial sweeteners . Currently , we have meals that contain as little as 3 grams of Total Sugar . When you are selecting your meals you are able to sort our meals from lowest to highest Total Sugar content .

Our menu does also list the full nutritional information for all of our meals . You would simply click on a specific meal on our menu in order to bring up that meal &apos;s full nutritional information . Any meals on our menu that are considered spicy will have a small icon of a pepper right below it . Our meals with less than 500 calories will have a small icon that looks like a weight scale .

Freshly is a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week ! You are certainly able to skip deliveries or cancel your subscription at any point before your weekly deadline .

We don &apos;t freeze our meals , so your meals would arrive cool to the touch . We package our meals using insulation and frozen gel packs to ensure that your meals arrive fresh . You are certainly able to freeze any meals before their use-by date , so that they can be good for an additional 2 weeks .

All of our meat is free from antibiotics and hormones . Our beef and chicken are not labeled as grass-fed or free-range . We do strive to use organic and non-GMO ingredients whenever possible in our meals , but we can ’ t guarantee that all the ingredients in our meals are 100 % organic or non-GMO . However , this is only one of the standards that we use when choosing high-quality ingredients from trusted partners .

I truly hope this information helps !

Wanda , please let me know if you have any questions or if you need any further assistance . Have a great day !

Customer Care SpecialistWhat preparations would I have to do ?
Are the meals ready to go in the microwave ? I just noticed that you are replying from the Pacific time zone . I live in North Carolina . Does your service cover zip code 28212 ? Hi there Wanda ,

All meals would arrive fully cooked . You would simply store the meals in the refrigerator , and heat up when ready to enjoy . The meals are fully ready to go into the microwave when they reach you . Each meal has microwave instructions printed on the back of its meal sleeve .

We currently don &apos;t deliver to that zip code , but we will in early 2019 . We will begin delivering to your location on Wednesday , January 23 . You are certainly able to sign up now in order to lock in your first delivery for January .

Have a great day , Wanda !

Thank you for reaching out , and for your interest in Freshly ! I &apos;m so sorry for any trouble , and I &apos;d be happy to assist .

Our meals are single-servings , and you can choose from 4 , 6 , 9 , or 12 meals per week for each subscription . I &apos;m afraid , at this time , we do not have a family plan . However , I have seen customers have a subscription for each family member ( you can have multiple subscriptions under the same account ) .

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Hi there ,

On my last delivery I placed an order for the Veggie Penne and instead I was sent the Teriyaki Salmon Cakes . I really don ’ t like salmon so gave it away to someone , so I wasn ’ t sure if on my next order I could get the veggie penne delivered in addition to what I have scheduled or just get reimbursed for 1 meal .

Thank you so much for your help .

Jessie ProhaskaHi Jessie ,

Thanks so much for reaching out to us today and bringing this to our attention !

I &apos;m so very sorry to hear you were missing your Veggie Baked Penne ! It is very unusual for there to be any such problems and I want to ensure you that we will report the incident to our quality assurance team so they can investigate further . We are always seeking to improve our service and pride ourselves on high levels of accuracy , so the fact that you did not receive a proper order is very disappointing to us . Thank you for your patience as we work diligently to improve our service and ensure only the best possible outcome for our customers !

To express our apologies for your situation , I &apos;ve placed a $ 20 discount on your subscription for double the value of the meal , which will apply automatically the next time you are charged and expire if not used within 6 months .

I do hope this helps ! My apologies again for the trouble , Jessie !

( 09 : 35 : 18 PM ) Alondra : Thank you for reaching out to us !

( 09 : 35 : 40 PM ) Alondra : I certainly understand and will be more than happy to look into this for you !

( 09 : 35 : 58 PM ) Alondra : You &apos;re welcome and thank you !

( 09 : 36 : 03 PM ) Alondra : One moment while I pull up your subscription to look into this for you !

( 09 : 36 : 20 PM ) Kim Nagel : I ended up extending my travel and won ’ t be home go collect the order in time

( 09 : 36 : 33 PM ) Alondra : No worries at all , as I certainly understand .

( 09 : 36 : 37 PM ) Alondra : Just one moment please , Kim .

( 09 : 36 : 42 PM ) Kim Nagel : The email said they would try but I didn ’ t see that I was cancelled

( 09 : 36 : 47 PM ) Kim Nagel : K

( 09 : 36 : 51 PM ) Alondra : Okay , one moment please .

( 09 : 39 : 22 PM ) Alondra : I do see that your Monday , December 31st order is in production as when you also emailed in yesterday as well . Since the order is in production , we will do our very best to cancel the order and prevent the meals from shipping out to you . We cannot guarantee it , however , we will do our very best in doing so for you . If we are unable to do so , you will receive an email notification letting you know that the meals have shipped out . If you do not receive this email , then it means that we were able to stop the order in time before it ships out .

( 09 : 39 : 56 PM ) Alondra : The rep did go ahead and apply an in-house credit in the amount of $ 49.99 onto your subscription for which you were charged for . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically be applied towards your next open order at no additional cost to you .

( 09 : 40 : 27 PM ) Alondra : As a friendly reminder , your deadline is every Wednesday before 2 pm PT .

( 09 : 41 : 55 PM ) Kim Nagel : Ok . Yeah that ’ s exactly what I saw . There ’ s no way to stop it now that I sent it in 3 days ahead ? For sure ? I just want to avoid it sitting on my porch for 2 days

( 09 : 43 : 19 PM ) Alondra : I certainly understand , however , as stated , we will do our very best to cancel the order and prevent the meals from being shipped out . Since the order is in production , we are not able to manually cancel the order as your weekly deadline to do so has past and the order is now in production and will be shipping out tomorrow .

( 09 : 44 : 11 PM ) Alondra : Our production team will do their very best in cancelling the order and if we are unable to do so , you will receive an email notification letting you know that the meals have shipped out and you can consider that order on us and perhaps gift them to a friend or family member .

( 09 : 44 : 39 PM ) Kim Nagel : Ok

( 09 : 44 : 59 PM ) Kim Nagel : Yeah no one will be there to collect the order

( 09 : 45 : 10 PM ) Kim Nagel : Thanks anyways

( 09 : 45 : 43 PM ) Alondra : You &apos;re so welcome .

( 09 : 36 : 00 PM ) Keith Carter : I was wondering if I could get my meals delivered for this Thursday ? I ’ ll be back in town by January 3rd .

( 09 : 36 : 30 PM ) Taylor : I do apologize , Keith , but it looks like you aren &apos;t scheduled for a delivery this week . Our kitchen will have restricted hours over the holidays , this past Christmas and the upcoming New Years Day , so that our staff can spend time with their families . Same goes for the 3rd party carriers , thus limiting the amount of orders that can be shipped . Any major holiday weeks will default to the &quot; unable to deliver &quot; status &amp; amp ; you &apos;ll see this forecasted in your meal planner up to 3 weeks in advance .

( 09 : 37 : 03 PM ) Taylor : Your next delivery is scheduled to arrive on January 10th , the soonest we &apos;d be able to deliver again .

( 09 : 37 : 28 PM ) Keith Carter : Ok , I just wanted to confirm

( 09 : 37 : 53 PM ) Taylor : No problem , I &apos;m glad I could assist with more information about when to expect your next delivery !

( 09 : 38 : 00 PM ) Taylor : Just a friendly reminder , your weekly deadline to make any changes to your future orders is each Saturday before 2 pm PT . Is there anything else I can assist with today , Keith ?

( 09 : 40 : 51 PM ) Taylor : Since I have not heard back from you , I am going to bring this chat to a close . If you need further assistance , you can simply start typing away in your chat window to restart the chat .

( 09 : 57 : 55 PM ) Alondra : Okay , thank you for clarifying .

( 09 : 58 : 20 PM ) Alondra : We pride ourselves on high levels of accuracy , however , mistakes can occasionally happen . I &apos;ll certainly be reporting this to our Quality Assurance team . We &apos;re always seeking to improve , so having our customers report such incidents is definitely helpful !

( 09 : 58 : 33 PM ) Alondra : To further express my apologies , I &apos;ve gone ahead and applied an in-house credit in the amount of $ 18 ( double the value ) of the missing meal you did not receive . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically be applied towards your next charged order .

( 09 : 59 : 03 PM ) Mark McKee : Ok , I appreciate that . Thank you for your help today .

Cancelling the subscription now will also cancel and automatically refund the cost of your first order on Jan. 9th . Is this alright ?

( 09 : 58 : 04 PM ) Erik Collars : Correct

( 09 : 58 : 28 PM ) Erik Collars : This will delete my account ?

( 09 : 59 : 25 PM ) Erik Collars : That doesn &apos;t sound like delete

( 09 : 59 : 39 PM ) Erik Collars : Delete means remove account from your database

Thank you so much for reaching out to us !

I wish there was more I could do !

115 E. 23rd St. , 7th Floor , New York , NY 10010Hi Jodi-Marie ,

Thanks for reaching out !

I &apos;m so sorry for any confusion ! At this time you should be receiving your order on December 15th . The tracking information might not have a recent updated scan . If you try to track your package tomorrow you should see an updated scan . For some reason if you don &apos;t you can always reach out to us so we can further assist you and accommodate you .

As a friendly reminder we are a weekly subscription service so we renew your card each week . However we give you the option to skip a week and choose new meals each week . You can be sure to make these changes each week by your weekly deadline . Your weekly deadline is every Monday by 2 pm PT .

I hope this information was helpful ! Please feel free to reach out !

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! HI , first shipment newbie , so if this is standard , my apologies . I understand shipping is often beyond your control , so if this is standard , I &apos;ll learn . But my notice from you says expect to receive shipment on Saturday while fedex says next Wednesday . Especially this time of the year , shipping is subject to a lot of variables , but a 4-5 day difference in guestimates is pretty significant . It makes me wonder about how &quot; fresh &quot; my food will actually be . Just wanted you to know . LukeHello Luke ,

Thank you for reaching out to Freshly today !

I &apos;m so sorry if there was any confusion on when your order would be delivered ! The good news is , upon further investigation , I have looked into your tracking information and can see that your order is due to arrive tomorrow , December 15th , on time ! I &apos;m assuming that when you had look at the tracking information , your package had not yet been scanned by FedEx and this is why you were seeing a later delivery date than expected .

Just as a friendly FYI , ( or reminder if you already knew ! ) we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Saturday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Monday before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


These are just a few of the really helpful links in our FAQ . You can always access even more information from our FAQ page by clicking on the &quot; Help &quot; tab in the upper right hand corner while logged into your account ! And of course , we are always happy to assist via email , text or phone at 844-FRESHLY or via chat ! Our current hours of operation are from 6am-11pm PT every day .

I hope this helps , Luke , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

&amp; gt ; order.Hello Debbie ,

Thanks for reaching out to us today !

I &apos;m so very sorry to hear your Freshly delivery was delayed ! We want all of our customers to have a convenient and worry-free experience and are very disappointed this has not been the case for you ! Rest assured , this issue has been communicated to our delivery specialist , who will work with our carriers to determine a cause in the hopes of preventing this issue in the future .

With that said , because you live in a 1-day transit zone , despite the meals arriving a day later than expected , they are still safe to consume ! Our meals are packaged with ice packs and are wrapped inside a denim insulation , so they are meant to withstand two days of travel , with an extra 12 hours on top of that , as most of our customers reside in 2 day zones . Therefore , as long as your meals arrive cool to the touch , they will be safe to consume !

As an apology for this inconvenience , however , as it is still a hassle to not get your meals on time , regardless of the fact that they would still be fresh , I have gone ahead and placed a $ 20.00 in store credit on your subscription . This discount will apply automatically and expire if not used within 6 months .

Again , my sincere apologies for this delay , Debbie , and if you have any additional questions or concerns , please don ’ t hesitate to reach back out to me !





Fresh wishes ,

( 11 : 17 : 33 PM ) Alondra : Thank you for reaching out to us !

( 11 : 17 : 53 PM ) Alondra : The use-by date is between 3-5 days upon delivery in the fridge . However , you can freeze the meals to extend the shelf-life , if you find that you are not able to get to them by the use-by date . All you will need to do is add an extra couple of minutes to heating time , when heating from frozen state .

( 11 : 18 : 12 PM ) Alondra : Since we do not use chemical / artificial preservatives , the meals do have a short shelf-life and is why we recommend to freeze the meals , if you find that you are not able to get to them by the use-by date .

( 11 : 19 : 13 PM ) Jennifer Tressler : Ok then , how do I cancel the plan ?

( 11 : 19 : 26 PM ) Alondra : The cancellation button can be found in the subscription settings . Here is a link for more detailed instructions if needed : https : / / support.freshly.com / hc / en-us / articles / 115005376428-How-do-I-cancel-a-subscription-

( 11 : 21 : 31 PM ) Katie Schliep : Hello I just signed up for Freahly and my first order is supposed to deliver on a Friday . Is there anyway to change that to mid week

( 11 : 21 : 51 PM ) Katie Schliep : I would prefer to get meals in the middle of the week rather than a Friday !

( 11 : 22 : 10 PM ) Alondra : The days that we service your area will depend on your zip code , so I can certainly go ahead and take a look into this for you !

( 11 : 23 : 13 PM ) Katie Schliep : No problem

( 11 : 23 : 37 PM ) Alondra : I do apologize , as I see that Friday , January 11th is the earliest delivery date available and for the next 2 weeks , there is only Friday delivery dates available in your area .

( 11 : 24 : 14 PM ) Katie Schliep : Ok so right now there aren ’ t other delivery dates outside of Friday ’ s ? Is that correct

( 11 : 24 : 25 PM ) Alondra : That is correct !

( 11 : 24 : 36 PM ) Katie Schliep : Ok . How long will the meals last in the fridge ?

( 11 : 24 : 55 PM ) Alondra : That is a great question !

( 11 : 25 : 03 PM ) Alondra : The use-by date is between 3-5 days upon delivery in the fridge . However , you can freeze the meals to extend the shelf-life , if you find that you are not able to get to them by the use-by date . All you will need to do is add an extra couple of minutes to heating time , when heating from frozen state .

( 11 : 25 : 12 PM ) Alondra : Since we do not use chemical / artificial preservatives , the meals do have a short shelf-life and is why we recommend to freeze the meals , if you find that you are not able to get to them by the use-by date .

( 11 : 25 : 42 PM ) Katie Schliep : Ok that makes sense to me . I am excited for our first meals to arrive . Thank you

( 11 : 26 : 33 PM ) Alondra : That is great to hear and we are looking forward to your feedback once you try your first set of meals , Katie !

( 11 : 26 : 42 PM ) Alondra : Just as a friendly reminder , we are a subscription service , meaning that we will renew your subscription every week , charge your card , and send you meals , unless you skip weeks or cancel the subscription .

( 11 : 27 : 25 PM ) Eric : Thanks for reaching out to Freshly !

( 11 : 28 : 23 PM ) Eric : Though we currently do not offer gift cards , you can order a subscription for someone else using your information and set the gift recipient ’ s address as the shipping address on the subscription . This would ensure that you are charged for the subscription , but that the gift recipient is the one who gets the meals . We will be offering gift subscriptions very soon however ! I will pass your inquiry along so that we can reach out when they are live !

( 11 : 29 : 07 PM ) Lisa Kwiatkowski : ok thanks . I definitely don &apos;t want my information attached to someone else &apos;s subscription so I &apos;ll have to pass. thank you thoughChat started : 2018-12-14 11 : 31 PM UTC

( 11 : 35 : 51 PM ) Taylor L. : While we don &apos;t currently offer gift cards it &apos;s something we &apos;re working to implement VERY soon !

( 11 : 35 : 56 PM ) Taylor L. : Though we currently do not offer gift cards , you can order a subscription for someone else using your information and set the gift recipient ’ s address as the shipping address on the subscription . This would ensure that you are charged for the subscription , but that the gift recipient is the one who gets the meals .

( 11 : 35 : 58 PM ) Taylor L. : To set up a menu for the first delivery , you &apos;ll want to get the recipients list of desired meals ( or select meals for them , ) then place the order ! We don &apos;t have trial options , so if you want to gift one week only you &apos;ll just need to cancel the subscription after the first order has been shipped . If you &apos;re ordering more than one week , you could share the login details with the recipient so they can make changes to their future orders ! The deadline to cancel or edit meals prior to the second order being charged will also be listed in your Welcome Email ! : - )

( 11 : 37 : 30 PM ) Kasia Ellsworth : what do I do when im not sure when to start the meals ?

( 11 : 38 : 16 PM ) Taylor L. : I would hold off on creating a subscription until you know when you &apos;d like to begin deliveries . I would recommend signing up 7-10 days prior to your desired delivery date .

( 11 : 38 : 46 PM ) Kasia Ellsworth : I see . OK . thanks .

( 11 : 38 : 47 PM ) Kasia Ellsworth : Also

( 11 : 39 : 22 PM ) Kasia Ellsworth : if the person has gluten allergies ( not sensitivity BUT allergy ) you dont have any corss contaminations , right ?

( 11 : 39 : 44 PM ) Taylor L. : We don &apos;t even allow our kitchen workers to bring meals containing gluten for their lunches !

( 11 : 40 : 05 PM ) Taylor L. : My pleasure , Kasia !

( 11 : 40 : 10 PM ) Taylor L. : A friendly reminder !

We are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week !

( 11 : 39 : 25 PM ) Taylor L. : Your shipping label is created a few of hours prior to your meals leaving our kitchen in Phoenix , Arizona . So at the moment it looks like the tracking is not up-to-date . In the next couple of hours , as your meals are scanned onto the delivery truck and leave our facility , the tracking will update with the correct delivery date listed .

My two questions then are : ( 1 ) Can y &apos;all call Fedex to correct the address so it ships before the food goes bad ? and ( 2 ) How can I fix my address online to be sure it fits on the package ? ( I have a very long address and I had issues this summer with it being cut off the label , which is why I switched to two address lines instead of one . I haven &apos;t had a problem with it again until now ) .

Customer Care SpecialistI would like to increase my weekly meal count but I am unable to change it from 6 .

Also , why will it be so long before my first meal - 3 weeks ?

Thank you ! Hello Lisa ,

Welcome to the Freshly Family !

Your first delivery is based on availability , and scheduling . With the exciting upcoming launch of our new kitchen , we currently do have a large amount of new customers eager to join ! I apologize that the earliest date available to start shipments is , Saturday , January 19th . However , after your initial delivery your shipments moving forward would be weekly , unless you decide to skip or cancel .

At this time , I am unable to change your meal plan for your first delivery . I apologize for the inconvenience , Lisa . I did see you changed your default plan to a 12 meal plan . I was able to ensure you have a 12 meal plan for your second delivery scheduled for , Saturday , January 26th and moving forward . Since we forecast deliveries up to 3 weeks in advance , making this change in the individual weeks in the Meal Planner is super important so that the change is reflected sooner .

Since you ’ re a new customer with Freshly and I would love to take this time to tell you a little more about our service .

We are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week !

Just a friendly reminder , your weekly deadline to make changes is every , Monday , by 5PM EST ( 2PM PT ) .

Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with . I am happy to assist !

Have a great evening , Lisa !

I just ordered freshly for the first time and the food that arrived isn ’ t what I ordered . The packing slip shows that I ordered spaghetti squash and meatballs but instead I got two of these shrimp ones .... I took pictures of my packing slip and the wrong food that you sent in it ’ s place . I was really excited to try freshly but if this is what I ’ ll have to deal with on a week to week basis , I probably won ’ t use your service anymore .

Sent from my iPhoneHi Blake ,

Thank you for reaching out to us !

I &apos;m so very sorry to hear that you received two Korean Style Shrimp meals instead of the two Spaghetti Squash and Meatballs that you wanted ! It is very unusual for there to be any such problems and I want to assure you that I will report the incident to our Quality Assurance team so they can investigate further . We are always seeking to improve our service and pride ourselves on high levels of accuracy , so the fact that you did not receive a proper order is very disappointing to us !

For this error , I have placed an in-store credit of $ 40 ( double the cost of the meal ) on your subscription as an extension of my apologies . This credit is valid for 6 months from today &apos;s date and will automatically apply to your next charged order .

As a friendly reminder we are a weekly subscription service , so we do automatically renew your card each week . However we understand that you might not want to receive meals each week . We give you the option to skip a week or a few weeks at a time . When you skip a week you won &apos;t be charged or receive meals for that specific week . You also have the option to choose new meals each week . You &apos;ll want to be sure to make these changes on your subscription by your weekly deadline which is every Monday by 2 pm PT .

My sincere apologies again for the trouble , Blake , and if you have any further questions or concerns , please feel free to reach out to me !

I just wanted to make sure that this wasn ’ t something that happens frequently as I choose the meals specifically for my diet and it ’ s alarming when the food you need is replaced with something you can ’ t eat . I appreciate the credit and look forward to my next freshly order . Have a wonderful New Year !

( 12 : 39 : 03 AM ) Kimberly Sully : 4275 Emily Loop Apt 1H in High Point North Carolina

( 12 : 39 : 08 AM ) Kimberly Sully : 27265

( 12 : 39 : 15 AM ) Eric : One moment .

( 12 : 41 : 27 AM ) Eric : You used to have Monday delivery at your old address . Your new address only has Tuesday through Saturday . We can try and get you delivery on the 11th at your new address . If not the soonest at the new address would be the 23rd which is a Wednesday .

( 12 : 42 : 10 AM ) Kimberly Sully : Tuesday would be preferable as the default

( 12 : 43 : 00 AM ) Eric : We can keep it defaulted to Tuesday . Unfortunately there are no Tuesdays for the rest of January as spots have filled up .

( 12 : 43 : 44 AM ) Kimberly Sully : The app said after Jan 27 , but the 29th is full too ?

( 12 : 44 : 25 AM ) Eric : Correct . More than likely it meant after the week of the 27th .

( 12 : 45 : 00 AM ) Kimberly Sully : Ok so we can start the first week in February ?

( 12 : 45 : 13 AM ) Eric : That &apos;s right !

( 12 : 46 : 15 AM ) Kimberly Sully : Can you confirm I will not get charged or anything until then ? Or do I need to manually skip every week until then ?

( 12 : 46 : 32 AM ) Eric : I can skip them all for you .

( 12 : 46 : 47 AM ) Kimberly Sully : Ok thank you .

( 12 : 46 : 58 AM ) Eric : Of course ! You &apos;re all set !

You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Wednesday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Thursday before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :

Customer Care SpecialistHi thank you for getting back to me so quicky ! One week available meaning youre completely booked ? Because my other family member has the app and it looks like this on their app . ￼ Normally you will see about three weeks in the meal planner , like your other family members , but because we are at the end of the month and this is your first order , you are only able to see your first delivery .

Customer Care SpecialistHi Megan .... I would love to try the meals out but the one thing holding me back is I was buying them for lunches at work and the only delivery days were Thursday and Friday and they only keep in fridge 4-5 days . In order for it to work for me , i would really need delivery Sunday , Monday and possibly Tuesday . Let me know if the delivery date is something that can be changed .

Thanks

Hello Heather ,

Thank you for writing in !

I am so sorry they we were not able to accommodate you previously , Heather ! I would be happy to look into this for you , and see if there are new days available for delivery . To further research delivery days in your area , please provide me your zip code .

Since we don ’ t use artificial or chemical preservatives , the meals as you know , have a refrigerated shelf life of about 4 – 5 days . Just so that you are aware , even though our meals taste best when eaten fresh , you can freeze them if you can ’ t get to them by their “ use by ” date ( located on the back nutrition label of each meal ) . You simply need to add a couple of minutes to the heating time and reheat from frozen , without thawing . We recommend confirming that the food is reheated to 165 degrees , the same as reheating from fresh !

I hope this helps , Heather !

If you have additional questions , please let me know . I am always happy to help !



Fresh wishes ,

UnsubscribeHello Christina ,

Thank you so much for reaching out to us , and for your interest in Freshly !

I am so sorry for any confusion . Our meals are single servings intended for one person . We design our meals to be satisfying , so that you will not go hunting for another snack later !

In addition , we believe in a modern approach to health that includes eating real , whole foods . Many processed and packaged foods contain artificial and chemical ingredients that may be harmful to our health . We have a strict banned ingredients list , which includes artificial ingredients , refined sugar , hydrogenated oils , and more ( read about our philosophy in the link below ) .

What is Freshly &apos;s Philosophy on Nutrition ?

Our meals are created around incorporating nutrient-dense veggies , high-quality proteins , and healthy fats into balanced meals that are both wholesome and tasty ( because food that ’ s good for you should taste good , too ! ) .

When it comes to nutrition , we offer a wide range of protein , carbs , fats , and sodium to fit the preferences of many different customers — so we don ’ t design our menu to strictly fit one specific diet . Instead , we offer dishes that fall into categories ( like vegetarian , high protein , paleo friendly ) that we label on our website so you can easily find the meals that suit your needs .

We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help you manage a subscription if you decide you &apos;d like to give us a try :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


I hope this helps , Cristina . If you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! After looking over the meal choices , I ’ ve decided not to order any meals at this time . Although most people would not consider the meal choices spicy , I do based on the ingredients – especially the cracked pepper and garlic . At 75 , my taste buds aren ’ t what they used to be .

UnsubscribeHey Ashley ,

Thanks for you interest in Freshly !

I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause ! Due to limited availability by our production team and our contracted carriers during the holiday season , in some cases we are not able to deliver until later into January . If you let me know the zip code you &apos;d like delivered to , I can certainly double check the availability for your area !

We are currently working on opening a brand new , state of the art facility in Maryland , which will allow us to produce and deliver many more meals across the US ! The demand has been much stronger than we initially anticipated for the opening of this facility in January , so we are working hard to fit all of our new customers in the normal weekly rotation of deliveries with our existing customers .

Just to give you a little more info on what we do , we are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

( 10 : 43 : 57 PM ) Taylor L. : We would be able to uncancel your subscription but the soonest we could get meals to you would be January 16th . Unfortunately the first week of January is no longer available as that order was canceled and refunded .

( 10 : 44 : 32 PM ) Taylor L. : I &apos;m very sorry for that inconvenience .

( 10 : 45 : 01 PM ) Erik Collars : Can you apply the rad40 promo and upgrade to the 6 meal plan

( 10 : 45 : 14 PM ) Taylor L. : Certainly ! Give me one moment to apply those changes .

( 10 : 45 : 27 PM ) Erik Collars : Im not sure why I wasn &apos;t given this option before they cancelled .. but

( 10 : 45 : 35 PM ) Erik Collars : Yea that &apos;d be great

( 10 : 45 : 51 PM ) Erik Collars : The week of the 14th ill be away actually

( 10 : 46 : 10 PM ) Erik Collars : So if that &apos;s the earliest , just set it for the next week

( 10 : 46 : 35 PM ) Taylor L. : Alright the soonest we could get meals to you the next week would be January 23rd .

( 10 : 47 : 11 PM ) Erik Collars : Thats fine . How long do they last by the way ? I put them in the fridge ?

( 10 : 47 : 18 PM ) Taylor L. : The meals that we send to customers have a use-by date of about 4 days after they are delivered - although the shelf life could vary slightly in some cases . You can check the “ use by ” date on a meal ’ s cardboard sleeve for more specifics regarding that meal itself . We do the best we can to ensure the freshness of our meals by packaging them securely and ensuring they are nice and cool during the shipping process .

( 10 : 47 : 27 PM ) Taylor L. : Our meals are designed to be refrigerated to preserve their freshness , but we understand that life happens and you are not always able to eat them right away . Therefore , if freezing is necessary , you can indeed freeze the meals . If you do go the freezing route , please follow these heating instructions : 1 . Do not defrost . 2 . Microwave for 1 min from frozen state . 3 . Follow original heating instructions provided .

( 10 : 48 : 07 PM ) Taylor L. : So I have you set with our 6 meal plan and I &apos;ve applied that rad40 code so your next two orders with us will be $ 39.99 , after that the base price for the 6 meal plan is $ 59.99 .

( 10 : 48 : 41 PM ) Erik Collars : Ok which I can change if I deem to much .. thats cool . 23rd works

( 10 : 49 : 09 PM ) Taylor L. : Perfect ! I have you all set for your first delivery with us for January 23rd . Your deadline for making changes to that order is Friday , January 18th .

( 10 : 49 : 21 PM ) Taylor L. : Your deadline for making changes to your weekly order is every Friday before 2 pm PT , and will only change if you alter your delivery date .

( 10 : 49 : 29 PM ) Erik Collars : Got it ! Perfect . Thanks you

( 10 : 49 : 34 PM ) Taylor L. : My pleasure , Erik !

( 10 : 49 : 37 PM ) Taylor L. : Is there anything else I can assist you with today ?

( 10 : 29 : 16 PM ) Eric : Thanks for reaching out to Freshly !

( 10 : 30 : 33 PM ) Eric : Whatever date shows as available will be all we can do at the moment due to high demand as we launch on the East Coast in Jan.

( 10 : 30 : 53 PM ) Eric : If Sunday is available as a day in your area , you can make it a weekly Sunday deliveyr .

( 10 : 30 : 55 PM ) Eric : delivery *

( 10 : 32 : 33 PM ) Moko : I see . I can &apos;t find any information about how to set up the delivery to be recurring - how can I set it to to receive meals every week instead of just one week ?

( 10 : 33 : 00 PM ) Eric : We only offer weekly subscriptions so what you are signing up for is an actual subscription .

( 10 : 33 : 21 PM ) Eric : The first delivery is typically discounted , but only as an introductory rate , not a trial .

( 10 : 33 : 30 PM ) Moko : what does it mean exactly ?

( 10 : 33 : 53 PM ) Eric : There are not trials . Once you sign up with us , you get a weekly subscription .

( 10 : 34 : 01 PM ) Eric : You can cancel or skip weeks at anytime .

( 10 : 34 : 07 PM ) Moko : How / when do I choose the meals for the following weeks ?

( 10 : 34 : 48 PM ) Eric : That &apos;s done in your Meal Planner . We send you a Welcome Email once you sign up with more information and a link to your Meal Planner so you can see future weeks up to 3 weeks out .

( 10 : 36 : 40 PM ) Moko : ah ok . Another question : I &apos;d like to receive the meals for the week every Sunday . How can I set it up that way ? If I start the delivery on Jan 23 , which is on Wednesday , my delivery date is automatically set to every Wednesday ?

( 10 : 37 : 28 PM ) Eric : You can choose Sunday once you set up the subscription or if that is a date option . Sunday is not an option in all areas so keep that in mind .

( 10 : 38 : 32 PM ) Moko : I guess I need to sign up before I get all the information I want to know . I will do that /

( 10 : 39 : 11 PM ) Eric : No worries ! Once you are signed up , it &apos;s much easier to explain details pertaining to a subscription ! We are here to help for any questions you may have .

( 10 : 39 : 46 PM ) Moko : Oh quickly , if I want to skip or cancel a plan , how much time in advance I need to let you know ?

( 10 : 40 : 22 PM ) Eric : You can cancel at anytime , but you have to skip a week before you are charged for it on your weekly deadline .

( 10 : 42 : 16 PM ) Moko : Okay , thank you !

( 10 : 42 : 21 PM ) Eric : Of course !

( 10 : 42 : 25 PM ) Eric : Is there anything else I can assist you with ?

( 10 : 44 : 35 PM ) Taylor : Our meals are designed to be refrigerated to preserve their freshness , but we understand that life happens and you are not always able to eat them right away . Therefore , if freezing is necessary , you can indeed freeze the meals .

( 10 : 45 : 46 PM ) perry rosen : I order said Monday January 7th . Just not sure what time and does someone need to be home ? ?

( 10 : 46 : 02 PM ) Taylor : The meals are packaged in a box with insulation made of recycled denim , along with a few non toxic gel ice packs to keep them nice and cool . Our packaging is designed to keep the meals fresh for 2 days of transit time , plus 12 hours on your doorstep .

( 10 : 46 : 41 PM ) Taylor : Each week , your meals could be delivered between 8am and 9pm , but this time frame is not guaranteed and dependent on the driver , the driver ’ s route , and other factors . You don &apos;t have to be home to accept your package , it should be left on your doorstep just like any other traditional package you may receive .

( 10 : 47 : 22 PM ) Taylor : Just as a friendly reminder , we are a weekly subscription service by nature . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . Based on your default delivery day of Monday , your deadline to make changes to an upcoming order or to skip a week is each Wednesday before 2 pm PT . Is there anything else I can assist with today , Perry ?

( 10 : 48 : 29 PM ) perry rosen : Ok . What if Im not satisfied with a meal . Can I get credit toward another one ? How do I cancel the delivery or change the date if I need to do so ?

( 10 : 49 : 45 PM ) Taylor : That &apos;d really just depend on the reason for it . We &apos;re happy to issue a credit in the event of a rare Quality Control issue . However , it &apos;s great to keep in mind that you are trying something new and it &apos;s not a guarantee everything will fit your palate . If you happen to be unhappy with a dish for any reason , simply reach out to let us know and we &apos;ll be glad to help .

( 10 : 50 : 30 PM ) Taylor : You &apos;ll need to submit any changes to the order menu or skip an order to avoid an unwanted charge anytime prior to the deadline mentioned above .

( 10 : 56 : 52 PM ) Linda Brittain : It says my new card is declined ...

( 10 : 57 : 35 PM ) Alondra : Are you able to take a screen shot of the message error that you are seeing ?

( 10 : 57 : 42 PM ) Linda Brittain : My other card was hacked ...

( 10 : 57 : 55 PM ) Linda Brittain : How do I do that ... ?

( 10 : 58 : 47 PM ) Linda Brittain : No error message ... Just the words &apos; Your card was declined &apos; in red ...

( 10 : 58 : 58 PM ) Alondra : If all of your card information that you are inputting once you go into your payment method and click on &quot; new payment method &quot; and then provided all of your new card information and click &quot; save &quot; then your new card should be saved and will then show as your new default payment method .

( 10 : 59 : 28 PM ) Linda Brittain : I &apos;ve tried it 3 times thus far ...

( 11 : 00 : 05 PM ) Alondra : It may be due to your card that you are wanting to use is being declined by your card-issuer bank . Is the new card that you are wanting to use active ?

( 11 : 00 : 27 PM ) Alondra : What type of credit card is it ?

( 11 : 01 : 05 PM ) Linda Brittain : Ah ... I need to activate it ... so sorry ...

( 11 : 01 : 21 PM ) Alondra : Oh okay , no worries at all , Linda .

( 11 : 02 : 34 PM ) Alondra : But yes , once you call to activate it , you can go back into your subscription settings and input your new card information and then save it as your new default payment method and then you are able to go ahead and delete your old card information from your payment method history .

( 11 : 04 : 19 PM ) Linda Brittain : I give up ... It &apos;s activated but is still declined ...

( 11 : 05 : 12 PM ) Alondra : I do apologize , as you may need to contact your card-issuer bank and see as to why they are declining your new card and not be able to use it for a form of payment method with us .

( 11 : 05 : 34 PM ) Linda Brittain : I &apos;ll do that tomorrow ...

( 11 : 05 : 44 PM ) Linda Brittain : Thanks ...

( 11 : 06 : 00 PM ) Alondra : Okay , no worries at all , Linda ! I do apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you !

( 11 : 06 : 10 PM ) Alondra : Is there anything else I can assist you further with today ?

( 11 : 07 : 04 PM ) Linda Brittain : Well , Stephen said he was going to give me a $ 20 credit for the meal I didn &apos;t receive ... Do that just hang out there until I get this straightened out ... ?

( 11 : 07 : 16 PM ) Linda Brittain : * does

( 11 : 07 : 27 PM ) Alondra : Yes , that is correct !

( 11 : 07 : 53 PM ) Alondra : I do see that he did go ahead and apply the $ 20 in-house credit onto your subscription and this credit will automatically be applied towards your next successful charged order .

( 11 : 08 : 28 PM ) Linda Brittain : Okay ... Awesome ... I &apos;ll try again tomorrow and then call Wells Fargo if it doesn &apos;t work ... Thanks , Alondra ...

( 11 : 08 : 57 PM ) Alondra : You &apos;re so welcome , Linda ! I hope it gets straightened out for you .

( 11 : 09 : 05 PM ) Alondra : Have a wonderful rest of your day !

( 10 : 50 : 41 PM ) * * * Breana joined the chat * * *

( 10 : 50 : 48 PM ) Breana : Hello Maria

( 10 : 50 : 51 PM ) MARIA ANEMONE : MY HUSBAND NEEDS LOW SALT TOO

( 10 : 50 : 57 PM ) Breana : Thank you for contacting Freshly !

( 10 : 51 : 19 PM ) Breana : I am so sorry for any confusion . While our entire menu focuses on incorporating real , whole foods , we do have a segment of our menu that is paleo-friendly . These meals do not contain any grains , dairy , legumes , or soy . You &apos;ll find these meals indicated by a badge labeled as &quot; Paleo Friendly &quot; .

( 10 : 51 : 49 PM ) MARIA ANEMONE : I DONT SEE ANY LISTED UNDER THE CURENT MENU

( 10 : 51 : 59 PM ) Breana : The sodium in our meals is a combo of sodium that ’ s naturally occurring in the ingredients themselves ( a medium carrot has about 50 mg of sodium alone ! ) , and a mineral-dense sea salt that we use to season our meals . The current FDA regulations are 2,300 mg of sodium per day and the average day Freshly meal is about 700 mg ( or less than ⅓ of the daily recommendation ) .

( 10 : 52 : 06 PM ) Breana : One moment while I look into that for you .

( 10 : 53 : 02 PM ) MARIA ANEMONE : SO ARE THE MEATS AND VEGGIES ORGANIC ?

( 10 : 53 : 28 PM ) Breana : We use organic ingredients as often as possible , but organic is just one of many characteristics we use to evaluate the ingredients we purchase . We research our sources for ingredients extensively to ensure that we use suppliers that meet our standards for freshness and all-around excellence .

( 10 : 53 : 59 PM ) MARIA ANEMONE : SO i GUESS THAT IS A NO ... NOT SURE THIS WILL WORK FOR US- THANKS

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Hello ,


Once again my package was not delivered to my door . Due to my work schedule I am not available to receive packages from the apartment office in a timely manner . This is a reoccurring issue and is a great inconvenience . Please refund this week .


Thanks.Hello Albert ,

Thank you for reaching out to us .

I am so very sorry that your meals are being delivered to your apartment office and not your door . Where the meals are delivered can vary , and since there is no note on your delivery to have those meals left at your door , this may be why the carrier leaves them at the office . Normally , this is done to prevent theft . To fix this issue , I will be editing your delivery address to have the instructions printed on the shipping label for the carrier to see .

The good news is that the meals are still safe to eat . We design our packages to withstand two full days of shipment , plus twelve hours at your doorstep , and this is day two . Because the meals are still safe to consume if you collect them today , I can apply an in-store credit in the amount of $ 20 for the inconvenience . This credit will be automatically applied to your next charge with us and will be available for a one time use within the next 6 months .

If you are not able to collect the meals before the office closes today , please do reach back out and we would be able to accommodate further .

I hope this helps explain , Albert . If there is anything else I can do to assist , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know .



Fresh wishes ,
Samantha L.

Customer Care SpecialistHello Albert ,

I ’ m so very sorry to hear that you weren &apos;t able to retrieve your package ! I can certainly understand your frustration !

To further express my apologies , I have issued a full refund in the amount of $ 59.99 to cover the cost of the meals you didn &apos;t receive , and you should see those funds post to your account within 3-5 business days . I &apos;ve also applied a 50 % in-house credit in the amount of $ 30.00 for the inconvenience . That credit will automatically apply to your next charge .

Please be aware that those meals would now be considered spoiled at this point and will need to be disposed of . I certainly don &apos;t want you to risk getting sick by eating any !

Once again , my sincere apologies Albert , and if you should need anything going forward , I &apos;m always happy to help !

Customer Care SpecialistHi , first I want to make sure that you service my area .

Dunedin , FL . Also , are your meals helpful in healthy weight loss ?

Sent from my iPadHi Nancy ,

Thanks for contacting Freshly ! My name is AJ , and I &apos;m happy to help .

A little about Freshly , we were started in Tucson , Arizona and now our headquarters is in New York City . Currently , all of our meals are prepared at our facility in Phoenix , Arizona and we &apos;re excited to announce that we &apos;re opening up another facility in Savage , Maryland in early 2019 ! This will allow us to serve your early starting in Early to Mid January , to find out exactly when we start , please enter your Zip Code at freshly.com .

We are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

We believe in a modern approach to health that includes eating real , whole foods . Many processed and packaged foods contain artificial and chemical ingredients that may be harmful to our health . We have a strict banned ingredients list , which includes artificial ingredients , refined sugar , hydrogenated oils , and more ( read about our philosophy in the link below ) .

What is Freshly &apos;s Philosophy on Nutrition ?

Our meals are created around incorporating nutrient-dense veggies , high-quality proteins , and healthy fats into balanced meals that are both wholesome and tasty ( because food that ’ s good for you should taste good , too ! ) .

When it comes to nutrition , we offer a wide range of protein , carbs , fats , and sodium to fit the preferences of many different customers — so we don ’ t design our menu to strictly fit one specific diet . Instead , we offer dishes that fall into categories ( like vegetarian , high protein , paleo friendly ) that we label on our website so you can easily find the meals that suit your needs .

If you have specific needs feel free to let us know and we can see if we have meals that will work for you !

Thanks again for reaching out tonight , Nancy . Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there &apos;s anything else I can assist you with . Thank you for considering Freshly !

So will I Received my order ? And if so it stated a date of January 11th is that when I receive it ? I also would like to know where it &apos;s shipped from ? Thank youHi Darlene ,

Thanks for reaching out ! So sorry for any confusion ! It looks like our FAQs are a bit out dated , as we previously could not deliver along the east coast , however , as of January , we will be delivering on the east coast , as our new kitchen will be open . While the kitchen is not open yet , we have begun taking orders for January , which would be why you were able to place that order . The order is still set for January 11th , and it will arrive from our new Maryland kitchen . I &apos;ll be sure to let our site team know the FAQs need updating , so thanks for the heads up ! : )

Just as a friendly FYI , ( or reminder if you already knew ! ) we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Friday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Sundays before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?



These are just a few of the really helpful links in our FAQ . You can always access even more information from our FAQ page by clicking on the &quot; Help &quot; tab in the upper right hand corner while logged into your account !

Customer Care SpecialistHello - I logged in to update my meals for next week and on two upcoming dates , December 28th and January 4th , it says &quot; unable to deliver to this address . &quot; I &apos;m not sure if this is because of the holidays or a permanent change to your delivery zone .

We &apos;re so sorry your delivery was delayed .




A note about your delivery












Dear Angela ,



We &apos;ve been advised by our delivery partner that your order didn ’ t arrive yesterday as scheduled . This is definitely not the type of experience we want for our customers .




The good news is that your meals should arrive today and are still fresh . ( Our packaging is designed to withstand two days in transit , plus 12 hours on your doorstep , and today is the second day of transit . )




Please accept our apologies — it &apos;s extremely frustrating to expect to get your meals and then have to make a new plan . As a thanks for your patience and understanding , we ’ ve added a
$ 10 in-store credit to your subscription ; this will be valid for six months from now and will automatically apply the next time you &apos;re charged for an order .




Again , we &apos;re so sorry about this ! If you have any questions at all , you can reach our Delivery Team using the contact icons below .




Sincerely ,

The Freshly Team

115 E. 23rd St. , 7th Floor , New York , NY 10010Hello Angela ,

I ’ m so very sorry to hear that you didn &apos;t receive your package as scheduled ! I can certainly understand your frustration . I &apos;m a Freshly customer as well , and I &apos;m very dependent on getting those weekly meals ! While incidents such as these are out of the norm , they can sometimes happen . I have reported this issue to our Delivery Specialist for further investigation into the cause of this delay .

To further express my apologies , I have issued a full refund in the amount of $ 39.00 to cover the cost of the meals you didn &apos;t receive , and you should see those funds post to your account within 3-5 business days . I &apos;ve also applied a 50 % in-house credit in the amount of $ 30.00 for the inconvenience . That credit will automatically apply to your next charge .

Please be aware that those meals are considered spoiled at this point and will need to be disposed of . I certainly don &apos;t want you to risk getting sick by eating any !

Once again , my sincere apologies Angela , and if you should need anything going forward , I &apos;m always happy to help !

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! I am so frustrated ! For the 2nd week in a row my delivery has been delayed . By the time it was delivered last week it had to be thrown out .

Last week was to be my first delivery with Freshly but I &apos;m not at all impressed with the service so far . Why can &apos;t you get the meals delivered on time ? ? ? ? Hello Mary ,

I do hope you will accept my sincerest apologies for all of the troubles ! Rest assured , I have forwarded your concerns to our QA and delivery team to review and contact you if need be .

These delays are definitely out of the Freshly norm , but due to the holidays , it has become quite of a heavier time for shipments . However , I want to make sure to make things right , Mary . I have gone ahead and issued you a refund in the amount of $ 24.99 for the week of Friday , December 14th . You can expect those funds within 3-5 business days depending on your financial institution .

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! I was so excited to eat my chicken with mac &amp; amp ; cheese . When I took it out of the box , I noticed the cardboard was ripped but didn &apos;t think anything of it . When I went to eat it , the hole was punctured through the box itself which rendered it not edible . I was then very sad .

Can I please get a credit for this ?

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Hello !


I just wanted to give some feedback . I ordered the butternut squash risotto which was delicious but the amount was very small . The butternut squash in my mind should take the place of a chicken breast for instance ( or at least closer ) and there were only 5 tiny pieces .


I don ’ t plan on ordering that dish again for this reason so I thought it best to send feedback .


If you guys make a change , I ’ d love to order it again .


Thanks !

If you ever get tired of waiting , you can expound on your issue now and close the chat and we will email you ASAP with a response ! We are typically able to get back to customers within the hour.Hi Chris ,

Thanks for contacting Freshly ! My name is AJ , and I &apos;m happy to assist you .

I &apos;ve canceled your order scheduled for delivery on Wednesday , December 19th and refunded your payment method $ 59.99 . Please allow 3-5 business days for the refund to show on your account .

Just as a friendly FYI , ( or reminder if you already knew ! ) we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any payments or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline . Based on your chosen delivery day of Wednesday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Thursday before 2 : 00 pm PT .

I hope this helps , Chris . Please let me know if there &apos;s anything else I can assist you with tonight . Safe travels !



Fresh wishes ,
AJ M.

Because there are many challenges around having both gluten AND gluten free items in our kitchen , we decided to remain entirely gluten free .

( 12 : 38 : 04 AM ) Mark Vibert : We &apos;re contemplating this as a gift , and see that there is a per week promo for 6 meals / week for $ 39.99 . Is there a fixed amount of weeks that is purchased or can I buy , say just one or two weeks ? Also , if for just one week , to all 6 meals for that week get delivered at once or throughtout the week ?

( 12 : 38 : 20 AM ) Taylor L. : Hello Mark , thanks for reaching out !

( 12 : 38 : 51 AM ) Taylor L. : We don &apos;t currently offer a gift card function but it is something we &apos;re working towards VERY soon .

( 12 : 39 : 28 AM ) Taylor L. : Our current 6 meals for $ 39.99 promo is for only one week of deliveries . We do deliver all meals in one delivery on your selected delivery date .

( 12 : 39 : 31 AM ) Taylor L. : Though we currently do not offer gift cards , you can order a subscription for someone else using your information and set the gift recipient ’ s address as the shipping address on the subscription . This would ensure that you are charged for the subscription , but that the gift recipient is the one who gets the meals .

( 12 : 39 : 40 AM ) Taylor L. : To set up a menu for the first delivery , you &apos;ll want to get the recipients list of desired meals ( or select meals for them , ) then place the order ! We don &apos;t have trial options , so if you want to gift one week only you &apos;ll just need to cancel the subscription after the first order has been shipped . If you &apos;re ordering more than one week , you could share the login details with the recipient so they can make changes to their future orders ! The deadline to cancel or edit meals prior to the second order being charged will also be listed in your Welcome Email ! : - )

( 12 : 41 : 40 AM ) Mark Vibert : Uh , okay , but so if I subscribe , is this a perpetual subscription , that is , unless I actively cancel it it would go on forever , or a year or ... ?

( 12 : 42 : 27 AM ) Taylor L. : Correct .

( 12 : 42 : 28 AM ) Taylor L. : We are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week !

( 12 : 44 : 37 AM ) Mark Vibert : Okay . Thanks for the info . Happy holidays . Out .

( 12 : 59 : 15 AM ) Andrea Hansis : for sure

( 01 : 00 : 04 AM ) Mahriah : Thanks ! I appreciate your patience .

( 01 : 01 : 14 AM ) Mahriah : I do see that the tracking shows as pending , however there was activity on your package today . As of 4 : 09 am this morning , the package was out for delivery . Typically FedEx can deliver until 8 : 00 pm local time , however they are now operating on their holiday delivery schedule and may deliver until midnight .

( 01 : 01 : 25 AM ) Mahriah : So we do need to allow them until that time to attempt delivery .

( 01 : 01 : 41 AM ) Mahriah : If they do not deliver by that time , we will be more than happy to fully accommodate you for this order .

( 01 : 01 : 50 AM ) Andrea Hansis : i just got off chat with them and they said it was out for delivery and they are now not delivering it today

( 01 : 02 : 01 AM ) Mahriah : Did they say why ?

( 01 : 02 : 07 AM ) Andrea Hansis : i saw the status change from out for dleivery to pending and contacted them first

( 01 : 02 : 10 AM ) Andrea Hansis : high volume

( 01 : 02 : 14 AM ) Andrea Hansis : will be delivered tomorrow

( 01 : 02 : 17 AM ) Mahriah : Okay I see .

( 01 : 02 : 20 AM ) Andrea Hansis : if im even here , after waiting around all day today

( 01 : 02 : 31 AM ) Andrea Hansis : and also its fresh food how long can it sit in a truck or warehouse ?

( 01 : 03 : 09 AM ) Mahriah : I do apologize for the inconvenience this causes . We do not require you to be home for the package to be delivered or require a signature , as they are supposed to leave the package at the door .

( 01 : 03 : 34 AM ) Andrea Hansis : i live in a neighborhood where it can be stolen as well , which is why i wanted to be here and chose today

( 01 : 03 : 38 AM ) Mahriah : Our packaging is designed to keep your meals nice and fresh for 2 days of transit time plus 12 hours outside upon delivery , however since you live in a 2-day delivery zone , those meals will no longer be fresh or safe to consume if they arrive tomorrow .

( 01 : 03 : 50 AM ) Andrea Hansis : i dont want to use services which rely on these carriers -- they arent reliable ( the carriers )

( 01 : 04 : 05 AM ) Mahriah : Give me just a few moments to report this to our Delivery Specialist and accommodate you for this order .

( 01 : 04 : 12 AM ) Andrea Hansis : many thanks

( 01 : 04 : 40 AM ) Mahriah : You &apos;re welcome ! This will take just a few moments .

( 01 : 06 : 26 AM ) Mahriah : I have issued a refund of $ 39.99 back to your card on file . Please allow 3-5 business days for these funds to process ,

( 01 : 07 : 17 AM ) Mahriah : Additionally , I &apos;ve added a 100 % in-store credit of $ 59.99 to the subscription . This one time credit will be available to use for up to six months from today and will apply automatically to your next charged order .

( 01 : 07 : 58 AM ) Andrea Hansis : okay thank you. perhaps i &apos;ll try again when busy season is over and deliveries are slightly less unreliable

( 01 : 08 : 07 AM ) Mahriah : At this time , I see you &apos;ve skipped tyour December 21st order and we are unable to deliver to your area during the following two weeks due to the holidays .

( 01 : 08 : 20 AM ) Mahriah : Would you like me to cancel your subscription at this time ?

( 01 : 03 : 30 AM ) Eric : Thank you for waiting . It seems there was a delay at OnTrac that caused the package not to be placed on the truck in time . It will be delivered tomorrow and those meals will luckily still be good to eat .

( 01 : 03 : 51 AM ) Eva : That &apos;s unfortunate to hear .

( 01 : 04 : 16 AM ) Eva : I count on the freshness of it coming when specified , since it takes many days to consume .

( 01 : 04 : 40 AM ) Eric : For the delay I &apos;ve added a $ 12 in store credit . This one-time use credit will be automatically applied towards your next order charge and if not used then , will be available for up to 6 months .

( 01 : 04 : 51 AM ) Eva : Thank you .

( 01 : 04 : 58 AM ) Eric : Of course !

( 01 : 05 : 01 AM ) Eva : How many days will they be good for after I receive them .

( 01 : 05 : 44 AM ) Eric : Typically it &apos;s between 4 to 5 days since we don &apos;t use chemical or artificial preservatives . I would still go by the Use By Date on the back of each meal .

( 01 : 05 : 50 AM ) Eric : You may , if needed , freeze meals to make them last longer - in which case , when it comes time to heat the meals , simply microwave for one to two minutes from the frozen state prior to following the printed heating instructions .

Customer Care Specialist @ getfreshly Where are the breakfast options ? @ flamesplash Hi ! We &apos;ve removed breakfasts off our menu for the time being in order to put a focus on our entree meals , but definitely keep an eye out , as they may come back in the near future ! @ getfreshly Hmm , ok . This will likely cause me to cancel more weeks than before . 6 entrees is too much for 1 person . @ flamesplash Our apologies for any inconvenience ! We do offer a 4 meal plan as well !

Customer Care SpecialistHow do I look at the meals without giving you personal info ? Hi Ann ,

Thank you for reaching out , and for your interest in Freshly ! I am so sorry for any trouble viewing our menu .

You can view the full menu ( updated as of this week ) at this link :

https : / / www.freshly.com / on-the-menu

Since you are interested in Freshly , I also wanted to provide more information about us . We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help you manage a subscription if you decide you &apos;d like to give us a try :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


I hope this helps , Ann , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

Have a wonderful day !

Wellness SpecialistOk . What about healthy , American comfort food meals ? Burgers , pork ... A lot of foreign food ... what about healthy , American comfort food ? Hi Ann ,

Thank you for your response , and I apologize for any inconvenience !

We try to offer a variety of cuisines , based on customer feedback , and we do try to add a new item to the rotation about every week or so . For American comfort-style dishes , you may like the Steak Peppercorn ( a customer favorite ) , the BBQ Shredded Beef , Turkey Shepard &apos;s Pie , or Homestyle Chicken with Butternut Mac n Cheese !

Our meals are created around incorporating nutrient-dense veggies , high-quality proteins , and healthy fats into balanced meals that are both wholesome and tasty ( because food that ’ s good for you should taste good , too ! ) . If you ever have any feedback on our meals , you can rate them in your meal planner or reach out to us , and we &apos;d be happy to submit your feedback !

Please let me know if you have any other questions , Ann . I &apos;m happy to help !

Have a great rest of your day !

Wellness SpecialistMy daughter has full dentures , so a lot of foods are difficult to chew . Unless the shredded beef dishes are really tender , the beef is hard to chew ( for anyone ) . We &apos;re both trying to eat healthy , and our friend orders your meals and was telling us about your food . I &apos;m looking for something that doesn &apos;t take a long time and a lot of prep . But , we want food that we &apos;ll like . Will think about it .
Thanks.Hi Ann ,

I understand , and I hope we are a good fit for you ! We definitely have the prepping covered for you . All you need to do is heat them up !

If you &apos;re looking for meals that are softer to chew , I would recommend the chilis ( we have Beef and Three Bean Ancho Turkey ) , Butternut Squash Risotto , and Penne dishes ( Bolognese or Veggie ) !

Please reach out should you have any other questions or if you need any further assistance . We &apos;re always happy to help . Have a great rest of your day !

Wellness SpecialistThank you for the prompt response . I ’ m most definitely interested , but I feel more comfortable knowing my order will deliver the same week that my payment was taken . Being that my whole interest with your company is helping me stay away from the grocery every other day or at least once a week . This order will keep food readily available in my freezer for my late nights that I work .

Thanks for your help .

Rest assured , the first order may be further out than a week depending on delivery availability in your area , but you would be in the regular rotation for weekly orders after . If anything were to happen to your first order , we would absolutely accommodate you accordingly !

UnsubscribeHello Shelly ,

Thank you so much for reaching out ,

As a little background , we create our menu around high-quality proteins , healthy fats , and complex carbs that come from nutrient-dense veggies , whole grains , and natural sweeteners .

We know that our customers have a wide range of preferences when it comes to carb content so we aim to deliver a wide range of options . Our delicious Freshly meals range from about 15 grams of carbs ( and as low as 11 net carbs , or total carbs minus fiber content ) , up to about 60 grams in some of our whole-grain dishes . Some of our meals have a badge indicating that they are 35 grams of carbs or less so that you can easily find them while choosing meals on our menu .

Shelly , because “ low carb ” does not have one standard FDA definition , goals for eating “ low carb ” vary . We recently launched a sort feature in the top righthand corner of the &quot; Choose Meals &quot; page so you can sort by carbs , from lowest to highest . Our meals currently range from 16g of carbs to 79g of carbs . Below , I will provide a link that may help you in sorting meals that best suit you .

How do I sort the menu by nutritional values ?

This tool is useful if you have a specific goal in mind . However , if you have any pre-existing medical conditions , we do recommend that you work with your doctor or nutritionist to determine what meals are right for you .

Not to mention , we also have delicious meals on our menu that are keto inspired ! While we don &apos;t necessarily design our meals to be ketogenic , we do have many customers who order from us as part of their keto plans . When it comes to keto , the number of carbs that each person can consume to stay in ketosis may vary . Below , I will provide a few options that fall below 25 grams of net carbs ,

- Buffalo Chicken Breast 16g carbs / 12g net carbs
- Sicilian-Style Chicken Parm 16g carbs / 11g net carbs
- Jamaican-Style Chicken 24g carbs / 19g net carbs
- Spaghetti Squash &amp; amp ; Meatballs 25g carbs / 22g net carbs
- Slow Cooked Beef Chili 26g carbs / 19g net carbs
- Cauliflower Sausage and Peppers 27g carbs / 23g net carbs

Shelly , I hope I was able to provide a bit more insight ! Please let me know if I can answer any additional questions .

Sharon JeffriesHello there Sharon !

Thank you for your email , and I am so sorry to hear of the site confusion you are having !

I attempted to look into the system to see if there were any subscriptions under your email address or first and last name . Sadly , I was unable to pull up any subscriptions using your information . This would leave me to believe that you did not successfully submit the order with us . I can understand how frustrating this may be , so if you would like to reach out to our care team on the phone at 1-844-373-7459 , we can surely walk you through the sign-up process !

We hope to hear back from you very soon , Sharon , and if there is anything further I can currently assist you with , do not hesitate to ask !

Customer Service LeadI ’ ll save your number and call in a day or two .


Do you accept Venmo for payment like the website indicated ?


If so , what is the exact company name for banking ?








--Hello Sharon ,

Thank you for your response !

Sounds like a plan , Sharon ! As for the payment methods we accept , we do in fact take Venmo , Paypal , and major credit / debit cards ! As for the name Freshly would be under , you would see Freshly.com or in some case Freshly Inc. if we processed a charge !

Now to provide some details on our service , we are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help you manage a subscription if you decide you &apos;d like to give us a try :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


I hope this helps , Sharon , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

( 11 : 09 : 34 PM ) Taylor L. : Freshly currently offers four different meal plans for 4 , 6 , 9 , and 12 meals per week .

( 11 : 09 : 41 PM ) Taylor L. : These are priced at $ 49.99 , $ 59.99 , $ 89.99 , and $ 107.99 , respectively . Your plan of choice will arrive in a single shipment each week .

We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week .

( 11 : 10 : 42 PM ) Lisa : How long do the meals stay fresh ?

( 11 : 10 : 53 PM ) Taylor L. : The meals that we send to customers have a use-by date of about 4 days after they are delivered - although the shelf life could vary slightly in some cases . You can check the “ use by ” date on a meal ’ s cardboard sleeve for more specifics regarding that meal itself . We do the best we can to ensure the freshness of our meals by packaging them securely and ensuring they are nice and cool during the shipping process .

( 11 : 12 : 05 PM ) Lisa : So I could order 2 of one meal and 2 of another to be delivered on a Monday ?

( 11 : 12 : 35 PM ) Taylor L. : Delivery days depend on your area , if you could provide me with your delivery zip code I can check to see if we delivery on Mondays to your area .

( 11 : 16 : 05 PM ) Lisa : One last question .... are the meals freezable if we don ’ t get a chance to eat fir some reason ?

( 11 : 16 : 12 PM ) Taylor L. : Our meals are designed to be refrigerated to preserve their freshness , but we understand that life happens and you are not always able to eat them right away . Therefore , if freezing is necessary , you can indeed freeze the meals . If you do go the freezing route , please follow these heating instructions : 1 . Do not defrost . 2 . Microwave for 1 min from frozen state . 3 . Follow original heating instructions provided .

( 11 : 39 : 40 PM ) Stephen : Hi Dorado !

( 11 : 39 : 58 PM ) Stephen : You would receive welcome emails as well as be charged for your first order !

( 11 : 40 : 08 PM ) Stephen : I am happy to confirm that we have a active subscription for you !

( 11 : 40 : 44 PM ) Dorado Quick : i just made an order twice and after I sumbitted them noting happend

( 11 : 40 : 44 PM ) Stephen : What is the phone number you would have provided to us ?

( 11 : 40 : 53 PM ) Dorado Quick : i just made an order twice and after I sumbitted them noting happend

( 11 : 40 : 59 PM ) Dorado Quick : 3235231928

( 11 : 41 : 00 PM ) Stephen : I am sorry about that .

( 11 : 41 : 26 PM ) Stephen : The number did not bring up a subscription . I suggest try signing up again , but in incognito mode , or try using a different browser .

( 11 : 42 : 09 PM ) Dorado Quick : you just said I had an active subscription

( 11 : 42 : 44 PM ) Stephen : I am very sorry , I misspoke . I meant I am happy to confirm IF we have a active subscription .

( 11 : 42 : 56 PM ) Stephen : I am very sorry for my miscommunication .

( 11 : 43 : 23 PM ) Dorado Quick : okay , thank you , so i just made a purchase twice what now

( 11 : 44 : 03 PM ) Stephen : Since the phone number and your name is not bringing up a subscription , you would not have been charged at this time .

( 11 : 45 : 05 PM ) Dorado Quick : my paypal shows i was charged

( 11 : 45 : 25 PM ) Stephen : Is there another name or phone number you would have used to sign up for the subscription ?

( 11 : 45 : 32 PM ) Stephen : Also , can you send me screenshots of the charge ?

( 11 : 46 : 10 PM ) Dorado Quick : no other name or email

( 11 : 46 : 36 PM ) Dorado Quick : I logged in from the email link purcahsed on paypal and it confirmed

( 11 : 47 : 56 PM ) Stephen : Since a subscription was not created , it may show on PayPal that it was charged but the charge will not finalize through your credit / debit card , since there was not a subscription created there is nothing to be charged .

( 11 : 48 : 31 PM ) Dorado Quick : so what happened ?

( 11 : 49 : 22 PM ) Stephen : I am not sure , it sounds like there was an error with the browser communicating with out site . If you are wanting to try again , I do suggest trying through incognito mode through the same browser you are using , or trying a different browser altogether .

( 11 : 49 : 46 PM ) Dorado Quick : why icognito mode ?

( 11 : 49 : 52 PM ) Dorado Quick : that sounds suspect

( 11 : 51 : 08 PM ) Stephen : It clears the cache and acts as if you had never visited the site before . So any information cached previously would not come through and potentially cause issues .

( 11 : 51 : 27 PM ) Stephen : Again , if you are not wanting to use incognito mode , you can try a different browser .

( 11 : 53 : 26 PM ) Stephen : Hi Dorado , are you still with me ?

( 11 : 53 : 32 PM ) Dorado Quick : yes

( 11 : 53 : 36 PM ) Dorado Quick : what about now

( 11 : 53 : 36 PM ) Dorado Quick : ?

( 11 : 53 : 41 PM ) Dorado Quick : just tried it

( 11 : 53 : 57 PM ) Stephen : Yes ! I have a subscription pulled up now using your phone number !

( 11 : 53 : 58 PM ) Dorado Quick : it set me up for two weeks later than what I orgignaly ordered

( 11 : 54 : 33 PM ) Dorado Quick : and it didnt give me the 40 $ from my email

( 11 : 55 : 23 PM ) Stephen : I am very sorry about that Dorado . What I can do is provide a $ 20.00 refund and a $ 20.00 in-store credit that will automatically apply towards your next order or remain on your subscription for 6 months if unused .

( 11 : 55 : 32 PM ) Stephen : That would honor the discount promo that was offered .

( 11 : 55 : 48 PM ) Stephen : Please allow up to 3-5 business days for that to be returned .

( 11 : 57 : 19 PM ) Stephen : I am very sorry , as for the start date , it does look like earlier dates have filled up and are now unavailable . I am able to move the order up from January 26th to the 25th if you would like .

( 11 : 57 : 24 PM ) Dorado Quick : okay thank you so much

( 11 : 57 : 36 PM ) Stephen : You &apos;re very welcome Dorado !

( 11 : 57 : 37 PM ) Dorado Quick : not as smooth as I would like but it looks like we got it

( 11 : 57 : 53 PM ) Dorado Quick : so now I will be billed every week ?

( 11 : 58 : 12 PM ) Dorado Quick : How early can I choose my meals in advance ?

( 11 : 58 : 14 PM ) Stephen : Correct , since we are a weekly subscription service we will charge you and send orders to arrive every Saturday unless you skip a week .

( 11 : 58 : 36 PM ) Stephen : We provide 3 weeks ahead to view and edit . So as it gets closer to the 26th , more orders will come available to edit !

( 11 : 59 : 07 PM ) Stephen : Your weekly deadline to make menu changes or skip a week before you are charged is every Sunday at 2 : 00 PM PST !

( 11 : 59 : 35 PM ) Dorado Quick : okay and how long do meals last ?

( 11 : 59 : 45 PM ) Dorado Quick : And i just take to work and zap them correct ?

( 11 : 59 : 54 PM ) Stephen : They last about 4-5 days in the fridge , and yes you heat them in the microwave !

( 12 : 00 : 08 AM ) Stephen : You are able to freeze the meals to extend the eat by date ! You would just need to add 1-2 minutes to the cook time .

( 12 : 01 : 04 AM ) Dorado Quick : okay I ordered 12 meals and they come on a Saturday do i need to start eating them on saturday or can i start on sunday ?

( 12 : 01 : 29 AM ) Stephen : You can start on Sunday ! The meals will have a eat by date on the label to let you know when to consume them by !

( 12 : 01 : 44 AM ) Stephen : If you are wanting to freeze them , just be sure to get them in the freezer by the eat by date !

( 12 : 02 : 08 AM ) Dorado Quick : each individual meal or the box will have that date ?

( 12 : 02 : 17 AM ) Stephen : Correct !

( 12 : 07 : 55 AM ) Stephen : The app should not cause the issue . Sometimes , rarely , if it errors the first time and using the same browser causes issues in the sign up process . I &apos;m not sure if Safari has incognito mode , but that may work as well .

( 12 : 08 : 35 AM ) * * * Stephen left the chat * * * This being the third week in a row that our delivery was on Friday instead of Thursday , I called Customer Service and got a woman by a name that sounded like &quot; Tiffany &quot; but she was speaking so fast , I couldn &apos;t understand her and several times asked her to please slow down . Even after I explained to her that I am on the autism spectrum and cannot take in words as fast as she was giving them to me , she responded that she was actually speaking &quot; very , very slowly , &quot; as if the transmission of her words through the atmosphere were speeding up only on my end . I got off the phone with her , called five minutes later and got Jasmine , with whom I have spoken before and who was kind and very helpful , explaining the complications of all my credits because of the missed deliveries and helping me choose four more dinners for next week as I still thought the Friday deadline was 4 : 00 p.m Pacific time but , unbeknownst to me , had been changed to 2 : 00 p.m. and it was then 2 : 30 . Thank you for giving me the opportunity to give feedback on my treatment with Customer Service . Katherine Sylvan , sksylvan @ gmail.comHi . Do you meals ship the same day they are made ? Hello , thank you for reaching out to Freshly ! Depending on your area , it could take about 5 or 6 days to prepare your order . 3 for confirming the order and preparing for the ingredients , one for cooking the meals , and the next for delivery .
Fresh wishes ,
Samantha L.

Customer Care SpecialistThere could also be an extra day of shipment , which would make 6 days .
Fresh wishes ,
Samantha L.

Customer Care SpecialistI think you misunderstand what I am asking . Once an order is verified and the meal has been cooked . When does it leave the facility after it has been made . The same day , the next day etcThe meals are prepared as we receive orders . They are cooked and then packed and shipped the next day .
Fresh wishes ,
Samantha L.

Customer Care SpecialistOk thank you. so if they are good for 4 to 5 days and it is 2 days for shipping and they ship the day after they are made ... then am I correct that a meal will remain good for 1 to 2 days after they are received.The meals that we send to customers have a use-by date of about 4 days after they are delivered - although the shelf life could vary slightly in some cases .
Fresh wishes ,
Samantha L.

Customer Care SpecialistHi againHello ! Are there any other questions that I can answer for you at this time ?
Fresh wishes ,
Samantha L.

Customer Care SpecialistYes please . With steak items how is the steak prepared ? The steak is cooked medium-well .
Fresh wishes ,
Victoria R.

Customer Care SpecialistOh . That is disappointing . Can you request different doneness levels ? I &apos;m terribly sorry , but we cannot customize meals or make any special requests at this time .
Fresh wishes ,
Victoria R.

Customer Care SpecialistWhat a terrible thing to do to red meat . Are there any plans to stop over cooking steak or provide an option to customers ? We don ’ t have the ability to customize the meals you see on our website because of the huge number of meals we cook every week - about 300,000 ! To allow for this , we prepare all our meals in batches and therefore can ’ t customize at this time .
Fresh wishes ,

Customer Care SpecialistI seeIs it possible to see meal plans for the month ahead ? Or previous plans to see the kind of options availableOr can you only see what is currentWe have on menu located on our website for you to see what we have to offer each week . I do apologize , but we have no way of showing our menu a month in advance . Here is a link to our menu : https : / / www.freshly.com / on-the-menu

115 E. 23rd St. , 7th Floor , New York , NY 10010Hi Christine ,

Thanks for reaching out !

I totally understand ! To clarify you would like to skip the weeks of Friday , December 21 , 2018 and Friday , December , 28th ? Also the meals will last 3-5 days in the fridge . However if you need to freeze the meals you most certainly can to preserve the shelf life .

I hope this information was helpful ! Please feel free to reach out !

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! My delivery today only had four meals instead of the six I ordered . It was missing the sausage penne and chicken polenta meals .

Sent from my iPhoneHello Mary ,

Thank you for reaching out to us today .

I &apos;m so sorry you didn &apos;t receive the Sausage Penne of Chicken Polenta . In rare occasions meals can be misplaced or missed , so I &apos;m sorry it seems you may have been a victim of such circumstance .

I &apos;ve applied an in-store credit of $ 40 for the value of that meal as well as the inconvenience , this credit will automatically apply to your next order with us . I &apos;ll also be forwarding this issue to our Quality Assurance team to look into and try to ensure this doesn &apos;t happen again .

I hope this helps , Mary , and please don &apos;t hesitate to reach out with any questions or concerns you may have .

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! I received an email from you that you were having difficulty processing my order . The credit card issued by my bank was set to expire at the end of the month . This is the credit card you have on file . My bank issued me a new card with the same number , a new expiration date , and a new security code . In going into my account to update the payment information , I was unable to do so . It would not let me edit the information of the current card to reflect the new expiration date and security code . When I try to enter the information as a new payment method , it does not allow me to complete the process . I finish putting in my information and then am not able to proceed . Please help . Thank you !

Sent from my iPhoneHello Ruth ,

Thank you for reaching out to us ! I do apologize for any inconvenience or confusion this may have caused you !

I do apologize , as we do not have the feature to edit the current credit card information of your default payment method . So once you are in your subscription settings , you will need to click on &quot; change &quot; and then click on &quot; New Payment Method &quot; and then go ahead and enter your new card information . Once you have done so , you will go ahead and then click on &quot; save &quot; . Once you have saved your new information , you are all set and our automated system will go ahead and re-attempt to charge you for your Wednesday , December 19th order , as it attempts a total of 4 times within 24 hours of your weekly deadline and the first attempt had failed . So it will re-attempt 3 more times and if successful , then your order will move into production as scheduled .

Here is a helpful link on how to change your default payment method !

How can I change the default payment method ?

How do I change my default payment method in the app ?

Can I delete a payment method ?

I hope this helps Ruth , and if you should need anything further , please reach out , as I &apos;m always happy to help !

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Do you plan to offer Keto meals in the future . I see that you have low carb , but true Keto is less than 20 net carbs a day and your low carb meals are much too high in carbs to fit that.Hello Carolyn ,

Thank you for reaching out with this question today ! I &apos;ll be happy to help .

As a little background , we create our menu around high-quality proteins , healthy fats , and complex carbs that come from nutrient-dense veggies , whole grains , and natural sweeteners .

While we don &apos;t necessarily design our meals to be ketogenic , we do have many customers who order from us as part of their keto plans . When it comes to keto , the number of carbs that each person can consume to stay in ketosis may vary . We know that customers who follow a keto diet tend to focus on net carbs ( total carbs minus fiber , which results in the amount of total absorbable carbs ) . In that case , our meals begin as low as 11 grams of net carbs .

Here are a few options of meals below 25 grams of net carbs :

- Buffalo Chicken Breast 16g carbs / 12g net carbs
- Sicilian-Style Chicken Parm 16g carbs / 11g net carbs
- Jamaican-Style Chicken 24g carbs / 19g net carbs
- Spaghetti Squash &amp; amp ; Meatballs 25g carbs / 22g net carbs
- Slow Cooked Beef Chili 26g carbs / 19g net carbs
- Cauliflower Sausage and Peppers 27g carbs / 23g net carbs

We recently launched a sort feature in the top righthand corner of the &quot; Choose Meals &quot; page so you can sort by carbs , from lowest to highest . This tool is useful if you have a specific carb goal in mind . However , if you have any pre-existing medical conditions , we do recommend that you work with your doctor or nutritionist to determine what meals are right for you .

Now , we do not have any immediate plans on introuducing menu items that are solely for the keto diet , but I will be sure to forward over your valued feedback over to the correct department !

I hope this was helpful , Carolyn . Please let me know if I can answer any additional questions , and have a wonderful day !

AllisonHello Allison ,

Thank you so much for reaching out to us , and I &apos;m so sorry for any confusion in regards to your upcoming order ! I &apos;m absolutely happy to take care of this for you , as we certainly don &apos;t mean to catch anyone by surprise !

I took a look into your subscription and I do not see any activity as to cancelling your subscription yesterday and your subscription was still active when our system charged you for your Wednesday , December 19th order today at 2PM PT . Since the subscription was still active today , it is why you were charged for the order today . However , I do see that you have now successfully cancelled your subscription today at 6 : 15pm MST and I &apos;ve now gone ahead and cancelled your Wednesday , December 19th order and issued a refund in the amount of $ 59.99 back to your card on file for which you were charged for . Please do allow up to 3-5 business days for the funds to post onto your bank account ( depending on your banking institution ) .

If you choose to reactivate your subscription in the future , I have attached a link on how to do so !

How do I reactivate my subscription ?

Once again , my sincerest apologies Allison ! If you should need further assistance , please reach out , as I am always happy to help !

Even more rarely , an incorrect meal may be packed into your box .

But , in the actual list on your website of my selected meals for Dec. 20 , you will see that I deleted the POrk and selected Veggie Baked Penne . I want to be sure I do not receive the Pork , as it is spicy . Could you please check and make sure the Veggie Baked Penne is there ?

( 01 : 15 : 28 AM ) Taylor L. : I wouldn &apos;t recommend it just because we don &apos;t use any kind of preservatives or anything in our food so it goes bad faster than most meals and we don &apos;t want any dogs with upset tummies !

( 01 : 17 : 01 AM ) Marcia : also what If they are Gross lol

( 01 : 17 : 39 AM ) Eric : We only offer a subscription service at the moment . You are able to cancel or skip weeks at anytime and there is no specific amount of time you need to be with us .

( 01 : 18 : 27 AM ) Eric : As for our meals , we don &apos;t necessarily market them as dinner or lunch since you can use our entrees for both .

( 01 : 18 : 51 AM ) Marcia : Ok and how would I cancel ? Or what if I did not like the meals . ? I am looking for quick meal low calorie But not the frozen microwave taste .

( 01 : 18 : 58 AM ) Eric : We also recently removed breakfast from our menus so that they we can refocus our efforts on more entrees and even seasonal items .

( 01 : 19 : 21 AM ) Marcia : OH ok your web still says breakfasts

( 01 : 20 : 27 AM ) Eric : We &apos;re having someone go through our site and ensure we remove all mentions !

( 01 : 20 : 36 AM ) Marcia : and lets say I pick the 6 meals are they the same every week or do I get to pick new meals each time ?

( 01 : 20 : 54 AM ) Eric : You can always choose new meals from the 29 we offer .

( 01 : 21 : 17 AM ) Marcia : OH so the 29 meals are all you have menu does not change ?

( 01 : 22 : 14 AM ) Eric : We want to ensure the best variety in tastiness for our customers , so we add one new meal ( sometimes two ) to our menu almost every week . This would either involve adding in a completely new meal or revamping a pre-existing meal to make it even more delicious .

( 01 : 23 : 34 AM ) Marcia : Ok so what is the best bet for me to try the 6 meals . first BEFORE getting sent more ? Sign up for the 12 weeks ? Then cancel if I am not happy ? and last question How do you cancel ?

( 01 : 24 : 53 AM ) Eric : You can always cancel after we ship you your first meals so that you don &apos;t have to worry about being charged for more meals .

( 01 : 25 : 16 AM ) Eric : You can cancel via your subscription settings or just by contacting us .

( 01 : 25 : 25 AM ) Marcia : BUt it is just me so how can I possible try them before more are sent ?

( 01 : 26 : 25 AM ) Eric : You can skip the second week .

( 01 : 27 : 39 AM ) Marcia : will you be offering a 1 time trial or maybe once a month rather then weekly ? I would much rather do that as I normally cook .

( 01 : 28 : 34 AM ) Eric : Not at the moment , but it is something we are looking into .

( 01 : 29 : 06 AM ) Marcia : Ok well Thank you . I will wait and keep checking in then . Thanks for your time .

( 01 : 34 : 28 AM ) Taylor L. : However , we cannot change an account using Paypal to use cards instead , you would have to change the cards on Paypal .

On occasion , we may run out of the ingredients for a meal that you have selected , or there are instances where a meal has been discontinued and is replaced with another meal . Even more rarely , an incorrect meal may be packed into your box .

( 01 : 44 : 12 AM ) Taylor L. : I &apos;ve applied an in-store credit of $ 40 for the value of that meal as well as the inconvenience , this credit will automatically apply to your next order with us . I &apos;ll also be forwarding this issue to our Quality Assurance team to look into and try to ensure this doesn &apos;t happen again .

( 01 : 44 : 56 AM ) sarah marshall : Thanks so much ! !

( 01 : 45 : 09 AM ) Taylor L. : My pleasure , Sarah !

( 01 : 45 : 12 AM ) Taylor L. : Is there anything else I can assist you with tonight ?

( 01 : 45 : 44 AM ) sarah marshall : That ’ s it , I appreciate it . Your company has excellent customer service .

( 01 : 46 : 00 AM ) Taylor L. : I &apos;m so very glad to hear that ! Have a wonderful rest of your night and Happy Holidays !

( 02 : 15 : 46 AM ) AJ : The change just occurred this week , so it &apos;s definitely understandable that you missed it !

( 02 : 16 : 21 AM ) AJ : It has to do with our production facility on the East Coast starting and us needing to have our East Coast orders sent to production before too late in the evening .

Thanks for reaching out to us today .

I &apos;m so sorry you haven &apos;t received your order yet , I am showing it &apos;s still on it &apos;s way to you . Due to the holidays we are seeing some delays in regards to delivery times and are seeing packages arrive as late as after midnight . The good news is we do package our meals to be safe for two days of transit ( you &apos;re in a one day zone ) and at your door for up to 12 hours after delivery , just please be sure your meals are still cool to the touch .

We don &apos;t expect you to stay awake all that time , so if you don &apos;t see your meals first thing tomorrow morning please reach back out to us and we can accommodate you if it &apos;s been delayed further .

I hope this helps , Robert , and please don &apos;t hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns you may have .

115 E. 23rd St. , 7th Floor , New York , NY 10010Hell Audrey ,

Thank you so much for reaching out to us !

I &apos;m so sorry for any confusion in regards to your upcoming order ! Because these meals have already been cooked and are in the hands of the carrier , I ’ m afraid I wouldn ’ t be able to cancel the order . We do have a brief window after your weekly deadline where we can usually stop an order from going out , but I ’ m afraid that we &apos;re beyond that period of time . I wish there was more I could do ! Upon review I do not see a skip entered for this order but there is one manually entered for the upcoming one on Saturday , January 5th .

As a friendly reminder , your regular weekly deadline is Monday by 2pm PT if you need to make any changes to your subscription or individual order ( s ) .

My sincerest apologies , Audrey , if you should need anything further , please reach out , as I &apos;m always happy to help !



Fresh wishes ,
Juan C.

Customer Care SpecialistHi Juan ,


I also wish there was more you could do ! Becaus I ’ m out of town , the food you are sending will go to waste , which is a waste of my money . I have a limited out of money and time and I ’ m afraid I ’ m very disappointed in this service .


As a friendly reminder , you should remind your customers early , that is , enough of time to cancel the order so the food is not wasted .


Fresh wishes ,
AudreyHello Audrey ,

I see and definitely understand ! If you will be unable to receive these meals and place them into your fridge I can very much notate that and issued you a full in house credit of $ 59.99 for the inconvenience . This active credit is valid for 6 months from today &apos;s date and will apply itself automatically to your next charged order .

In regards to notification of when to cancel an order before it being charged and shipped , we do in fact do this by sending customers emails before their weekly deadline . The email will state it &apos;s time to edit the meals or skip it and if you did end up getting charged we typically have a day after available to stop it before heading into the production phase .

If you have any questions please don &apos;t hesitate on reaching out to us , we &apos;d be happy to help ! Have a good evening !



Fresh wishes ,
Juan C.

Customer Care SpecialistHello Juan ,


I did reply the day I received the email yet it was too late for the shipment .


I have canceled the subscription so the credit is of no use .


Have a good evening !


Fresh wishes ,
AudreyHello Audrey ,

Yes , I do see the cancellation now ! Just to be clear that does mean you shall no longer be charged or sent any future deliveries unless you manually reactivate , you should have also received a confirmation email .

As for the meals , since you were charged for an order you would not be able to enjoy I will as a courtesy issue you the full refund of $ 59.99 . Just be aware that it can take 3-5 business days to complete on your end and for this you too will receive an email confirmation .

I hope this helps , Audrey ! If you have any questions or concerns , please feel free to reach back out to me !

( 01 : 28 : 59 AM ) Taylor L. : How can I help ?

( 01 : 29 : 34 AM ) Jeannette McClendon : How much will I be paying each week . When I signed up I was on a promotional deal of $ 39.99 . When will that change

( 01 : 30 : 16 AM ) Taylor L. : So your next order with us will be $ 39.99 as well but after that our standard price for our 6 meal plan is $ 59.99 per week .

( 01 : 31 : 14 AM ) Jeannette McClendon : Ooh ok . Just checking . Another question . My next order is to come on Jan 12 . Will I be charged for the week of Jan 5 ?

( 01 : 32 : 15 AM ) Taylor L. : Nope ! We currently are unable to make any deliveries the week of January 5th as we &apos;ve given our production team time off to spend with their families for the holiday . Your next charge will be on Monday , January 7th at 2PM PST for that January 12th delivery . This will also be your deadline to make any changes to that order .

( 01 : 22 : 50 AM ) Edmund Olmos : Fedex admitted they mailed it to the wrong address

( 01 : 23 : 09 AM ) Martin : Just to clarify , the meals were delivered to the wrong address , but then your neighbor took them to your house .

( 01 : 23 : 19 AM ) Martin : Were the meals just sitting outside for 2 days ?

( 01 : 23 : 46 AM ) Edmund Olmos : Yes , took them to my house and they sat outside for 2 days .

( 01 : 55 : 09 AM ) Jay : Thank you so much for letting us know . I &apos;ve forwarded this information to our Quality Assurance Team for further investigation and review . While we pride ourselves on high levels of accuracy , when cooking and shipping nearly 700,000 meals per week , mistakes can occasionally happen . We &apos;re always seeking to improve our service !

For the inconvenience Luke , I &apos;ll be applying a $ 20 in-house credit to your subscription to cover the cost of that meal . This amount will be deducted from your next weekly order .

( 01 : 55 : 58 AM ) Luke Adams : Thank you , confirming another meal will not be shipped his week in its place ?

( 12 : 54 : 51 AM ) Jamie : Hi Diane !

( 12 : 54 : 55 AM ) Jamie : Thanks for chatting in today .

( 12 : 55 : 13 AM ) Jamie : Although we are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week , there are no contracts .

( 12 : 55 : 15 AM ) Diane Terry : Hello , I truly only want to order for one week .

( 12 : 55 : 28 AM ) Jamie : You can skip the weeks you don &apos;t want a delivery or you can cancel the subscription when you need to .

( 12 : 55 : 51 AM ) Diane Terry : I just want to pay by paypal , but I don &apos;t want an additional order at this time .

( 12 : 56 : 04 AM ) Jamie : We do have some customers that cancel after the first week so they have time to try the meals and decide if Freshly is a good fit .

( 12 : 56 : 42 AM ) Diane Terry : So , I can &apos;t cancel beforehand and just receive one order right ?

( 12 : 56 : 43 AM ) Jamie : I just wanted to let you know that you would want to wait until you &apos;ve actually received the first delivery .

( 12 : 57 : 08 AM ) Jamie : Otherwise , canceling beforehand will result in the delivery being canceled as well .

( 12 : 57 : 37 AM ) Jamie : So basically that day you receive it , go ahead and cancel so yo &apos;re not charged for the next order .

( 12 : 57 : 39 AM ) Diane Terry : So , if it &apos;s a weekly charge , I may be charged for the next order ?

( 12 : 57 : 56 AM ) Diane Terry : Okay , that makes sense .

( 12 : 58 : 01 AM ) Jamie : Ok , great .

( 12 : 58 : 06 AM ) Diane Terry : Thank you !

( 01 : 45 : 11 AM ) Alondra : Our meals also have badges on them that indicate if they are paleo-friendly , vegetarian , soy-free , dairy-free , fewer than 500 calories and 35 grams of carbs , or contain high-protein ingredients .

( 01 : 46 : 27 AM ) Kat : Do I need to be a client to use said tool ? I would like to browse the options

( 01 : 47 : 13 AM ) Alondra : You can pretend as if you are signing up and when you are choosing your meals , the &quot; sort &quot; tool option will be on the menu on the right top corner of the menu screen next to the &quot; filter &quot; link .

( 01 : 48 : 08 AM ) Alondra : However , you can just go to our on the menu link and you can view the Nutrition Facts and ingredients list of each meal by clicking on the image of each meal .

( 01 : 49 : 11 AM ) Kat : I &apos;m new to keto and would like the meals sorted out for me

( 01 : 50 : 14 AM ) Alondra : That is great to hear and you can go ahead and use the sort tool option by pretending to sign up and once you are on the third step which is to choose your meals , the sort link will be on there .

Thank you so much for getting back to us ! I ’ m terribly sorry to hear about your recent experience with our service . Please know that we take any and all issues of meal packaging and quality with the greatest concern . The seriousness with which we take these issues can only be compared to the rarity with which they happen . Your health and well-being are first and foremost in our minds - and , of course , is why we &apos;re in business to begin with !

I attempted to call you recently to connect directly and gather more information about your issue . I have a few questions I would like to ask so we can do a thorough investigation and report this issue properly . Please let me know a day and time in the next few days that would work for you and I will give you a quick call . If I am not available , I ’ ll make sure a colleague will handle the issue .

I have issued you a full refund for this order , in the amount of $ 39.00 . You should see these funds posted back to your bank account in 3-5 business days .

Additionally , I have canceled your subscription and there won &apos;t be any further charges or deliveries unless you choose to reactivate . You should receive a confirmation email shortly .

How do I reactivate my subscription ?

Thank you so much again for your patience and understanding , and I look forward to hearing from you soon !

Thank you for your timely response ! It would be extremely helpful if you could answer the following questions for me . This would go a long way towards helping us conduct a full and thorough investigation and reporting the issue properly .

· What type of object was found in the meal ?
· What was the approximate size of the object ?
· Which meal contained the foreign object ?
· In which portion of the meal was the object found ? The main portion or the side dish ?
· Did you sustain any injury associated with the object – and , if so , what ?
· Do you have any photographs of the object ?
· If you still have the object , would you be willing to send it back to us with a prepaid shipping label so we can investigate further ?

If you would be able to answer these questions , it would be greatly appreciated .

Thank you so much for your assistance .

( 02 : 12 : 37 AM ) Breana : I ’ m so very sorry ! It looks like your meals will not be delivered today as scheduled per a delay . Unfortunately , these meals are considered spoiled before delivery . While incidents such as these are out of the norm , they can sometimes happen . I have reported this issue to our Delivery Specialist for further investigation .

( 02 : 12 : 50 AM ) Breana : I &apos;ve gone ahead and issued that 100 % refund in the amount of $ 29.99 . Please allow 3-5 business days for that refund to be fully processed and applied back to your card .

( 02 : 13 : 19 AM ) Breana : In addition , I &apos;ve added an in-house credit in the amount of $ 20.00 to your subscription . This credit will be automatically applied to your next open order with us and will remain active on your subscription until six months from today &apos;s date .

We &apos;re so sorry your delivery was delayed . A note about your delivery

Dear Brian ,

We &apos;ve been advised by our delivery partner that your order didn ’ t arrive yesterday as scheduled . This is definitely not the type of experience we want for our customers .

Because of this delay , your meals will have been unrefrigerated for an amount of time that makes them unsafe to eat . As a result , we have asked the carrier to discard your package , although there &apos;s a chance it will still arrive . If this happens , please dispose of the meals without eating them . Your health is our top priority and we can no longer guarantee the freshness of your order , even if the meals still feel cold .

Please accept our sincere apologies — it &apos;s extremely frustrating to expect to get your meals and then have to make a new plan . Due to this , we &apos;ve given you a 100 % refund for your order ( this should appear in your bank account within five business days ) . Additionally , we &apos;ve added a $ 20 in-store credit to your subscription . This will be valid for six months from now and will automatically apply the next time you &apos;re charged for an order .

Again , we &apos;re so sorry about this and truly appreciate your patience !

Sincerely ,
The Freshly Team

GeorgiannHi Georgiann ,

Thanks for reaching out to us today ! I &apos;d be happy to help out !

Depending on where you are located , the available delivery dates could be for weekdays only or they could also include weekend days . If you could reply back to this email with the zip code to be delivered , I &apos;d be happy to find out the available delivery dates for your immediate area as well as the earliest available date for you .

If you &apos;d like , you can always visit us on our website ( link included below ) and enter your email address and zip code to see what current available delivery dates we offer for you . From there , you can also view the meals on our menu and also see the different meal plans we offer . Please know that whichever meal plan you choose , that number of meals ( i.e. 4 , 6 , 9 , or 12 ) will be shipped out in one package , once per week .


Freshly.com



Just as a friendly FYI , we are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals since there are no contracts ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which is about a week in advance of your delivery date .

I hope this helps , Georgiann , and I look forward to your reply . If you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

I am very interested in Freshly but I have a couple questions for you .
I travel around 2 weeks out of a month for work .
Is there a “ freeze ” option for the weeks I won ’ t be home ?


How long , on average , I can keep a meal in the fridge before it goes bad ?


Thanks

UnsubscribeHello Tolis ,

While Megan is out of the office , I am happy to help !

We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help you manage a subscription if you decide you &apos;d like to give us a try :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


Since we don ’ t use artificial or chemical preservatives , the meals have a refrigerated shelf life of about 4 – 5 days . Every meal has a “ use by ” date on the back nutrition label .

Even though our meals taste best when eaten fresh , you can freeze them if you can ’ t get to them by their “ use by ” date . You simply need to add a couple of minutes to the heating time and reheat from frozen , without thawing . We recommend confirming that the food is reheated to 165 degrees , the same as reheating from fresh !

I hope this helps , Tolis , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

( 02 : 31 : 51 AM ) Ron Williamson : I changed my delivery day each week to Thursday but your website still shows deliveries still shows the next 2 weeks the meals delivering on Friday &amp; amp ; I can &apos;t seem to change them on your website . Can you fix this ?

( 02 : 32 : 00 AM ) Martin : Hi there Ron !

( 02 : 32 : 07 AM ) Martin : Thank you for chatting in !

( 02 : 32 : 23 AM ) Martin : One moment while I pull up your subscription to look into this for you !

( 02 : 33 : 18 AM ) Martin : I &apos;m sorry to say that deliveries on Thursday aren &apos;t available until Thursday , January 24 .

( 02 : 33 : 44 AM ) Ron Williamson : Why would that be the case ?

( 02 : 34 : 17 AM ) Martin : It would be because there aren &apos;t any spots left for Thursday , January 10 , or Thursday , January 17 .

( 02 : 34 : 50 AM ) Martin : You can certainly check back in to see if they become available .

( 02 : 35 : 12 AM ) Martin : Sometimes spots open up when other customers skip their delivery .

( 02 : 38 : 16 AM ) Ron Williamson : OK but seems that since I changed my delivery day to Thursday before Christmas that there would have been spots open . I wasn &apos;t even able to order for the next 2 weeks until after Christmas &amp; amp ; I had already changes my delivery day prior to that . Doesn &apos;t seem right .

( 02 : 38 : 56 AM ) Martin : I certainly understand , Ron , and I &apos;m so sorry for any inconvenience .

( 02 : 39 : 33 AM ) Martin : Your default delivery day is now set to Thursday , so you should be good for Thursday deliveries beginning on Thursday , January 24 .

( 02 : 39 : 56 AM ) Ron Williamson : Thanks , hope so .

( 02 : 40 : 20 AM ) Martin : Of course !

( 02 : 40 : 23 AM ) Martin : Is there anything else I can assist you with ?

Customer Care SpecialistHi -Are there vegetarian dishes available for each meal delivery ?


Thanks
LauraHi Laura ,

Thank you for reaching out and your interest in Freshly !

We always offer a handful of vegetarian meals on the menu at any given time . While we don ’ t develop vegan meals at the moment , some of our veggie meals qualify as vegan . We list each meal ’ s ingredients so you always know what ’ s in your meals .

Currently , the vegetarian dishes on our menu are the Veggie Baked Penne , Butternut Squash Risotto , Southwest Veggie Bowl and the Moroccan-Style Root Veggie Tagine .

We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help you manage a subscription if you decide you &apos;d like to give us a try :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


I hope this helps , Laura , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

( 02 : 50 : 17 AM ) Jay : This has also affected other users as well in the area . My apologies . Typically , if any alternate delivery days were available for the week , you &apos;d be able to select them from the meal planner .

( 02 : 54 : 15 AM ) Jay : Since the week was not scheduled , you were not charged for the week . It &apos;s as if the week was skipped .

( 02 : 55 : 40 AM ) Christian Jacobs : Unfortunate but ok

Sent from AOL Mobile MailHello there ,

Thank you for reaching out to us today ! When signing up for Freshly you &apos;re only charged the price of the meal plan and that &apos;s it ! We do not have additional shipping fees as it &apos;s all included in the price no matter where you live .

UnsubscribeHello Geraldine ,

Thank you so much for reaching out ,

I am afraid to say we currently only offer the 4,6,9 , and 12 meal plans as options . So , you would have to choose an additional meal to complete your order . To receive the discount you would have to signup under our 6 meal plan . Below , I will provide a link to help you decide which plan works best for you ,

How much do your meal plans cost ?

Oh , and if your schedule can get too busy , you are always able to skip upcoming weeks before your weekly deadline which is provided once you complete your subscription . Since we are a weekly subscription service we would automatically charge and deliver those meals to you every week . But of course , you are in full control of your subscription , Geraldine . If you need to change the number of meals , skip a week , or cancel you can do so by your weekly deadline easily . Below , I will provide a few links to provide a bit more insight into our service .

What is the weekly deadline for changing my next order ?

How do I skip a week ?

How many portions are your meals ?

I hope I was able to help out ! If you have any additional questions or concerns please feel free to reach out , I am always hap

We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help you manage a subscription if you decide you &apos;d like to give us a try :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


I hope this helps , Jenny , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

( 12 : 05 : 44 AM ) Brice Malloy : My delivery was supposed to arrive 12 / 29 / 18 . Upon checking my tracking number it says it will not arrive until 1 / 2 / 19 . Is the food going to be expired before it arrives ? Also I &apos;ve had problems 3 of the last 6 orders with delivery . Hard to plan to use your product when it doesn &apos;t arrive .

( 12 : 05 : 52 AM ) Jamie : Hi Brice !

( 12 : 05 : 55 AM ) Jamie : Thanks for reaching out today .

( 12 : 06 : 29 AM ) Jamie : Oh , I &apos;m so terribly sorry to hear about your delivery and the recent experiences you &apos;ve had !

( 12 : 06 : 39 AM ) Jamie : Let me take a look at this delivery for you .

( 12 : 08 : 43 AM ) Jamie : Alright , Brice , thank you for your patience .

( 12 : 09 : 15 AM ) Jamie : I pulled your delivery information and I am seeing a delivery date of January 2nd at the moment .

( 12 : 09 : 42 AM ) Jamie : I know that with the recent increase of packages during the holiday season the tracking information doesn &apos;t always update with the correct date like it should .

( 12 : 10 : 19 AM ) Jamie : It does show that your package left the FedEx facility this morning around 9 AM so there is a possibility that it will still be arriving to you today as scheduled .

( 12 : 11 : 08 AM ) Jamie : Typically , the delivery window is from 8 AM - 9 PM , simply because these are the hours the drivers tend to operate .

( 12 : 11 : 58 AM ) Jamie : If your package doesn &apos;t arrive today and does on the 2nd , I &apos;m afraid the meals would no longer be safe to enjoy at that point .

( 12 : 12 : 29 AM ) Jamie : Our packaging is designed to keep your meals fresh for 2 days of shipping plus another 12 hours at your door and you &apos;re in a 1 day shipping zone . Anything beyond this time frame and we can &apos;t guarantee the safety of your meals .

( 12 : 12 : 49 AM ) Jamie : It would need to be disposed of if it arrived on the 2nd .

( 12 : 13 : 11 AM ) Jamie : I &apos;m very sorry about this , Brice .

( 12 : 13 : 45 AM ) Brice Malloy : Ok , I &apos;ll wait to see if it shows up later this evening .

( 12 : 14 : 14 AM ) Jamie : If it doesn &apos;t please do not hesitate to let us know so we can do our best to accommodate you for the delivery.Chat started : 2018-12-30 12 : 06 AM UTC

( 12 : 06 : 16 AM ) Anne Dougherty : can I gift 2 weeks of Freshly meals to someone ?

( 12 : 06 : 20 AM ) * * * Taylor L. joined the chat * * *

( 12 : 06 : 25 AM ) Taylor L. : Hello Anne , thanks for reaching out !

( 12 : 06 : 37 AM ) Taylor L. : We are working to implement gift cards but they unfortunately aren &apos;t quite ready just yet .

( 12 : 06 : 40 AM ) Taylor L. : Though we currently do not offer gift cards , you can order a subscription for someone else using your information and set the gift recipient ’ s address as the shipping address on the subscription . This would ensure that you are charged for the subscription , but that the gift recipient is the one who gets the meals .

( 12 : 06 : 42 AM ) Taylor L. : To set up a menu for the first delivery , you &apos;ll want to get the recipients list of desired meals ( or select meals for them , ) then place the order ! We don &apos;t have trial options , so if you want to gift one week only you &apos;ll just need to cancel the subscription after the first order has been shipped . If you &apos;re ordering more than one week , you could share the login details with the recipient so they can make changes to their future orders ! The deadline to cancel or edit meals prior to the second order being charged will also be listed in your Welcome Email ! : - )

( 12 : 07 : 39 AM ) Anne Dougherty : OK copy. thank you !

( 12 : 07 : 49 AM ) Taylor L. : My pleasure , Anne !

( 12 : 07 : 49 AM ) Taylor L. : Just a friendly reminder !

We are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week !

( 12 : 07 : 53 AM ) Taylor L. : Is there anything else I can assist you with today ?

( 12 : 08 : 00 AM ) Anne Dougherty : no thanks. bye

( 12 : 11 : 28 AM ) Jay : Could you please verify the phone number associated with the subscription ?

( 12 : 11 : 50 AM ) Carrie : 9182308518 , it &apos;s under my husbands name . Rob Loeber

( 12 : 11 : 55 AM ) Jay : Thank you !

( 12 : 15 : 02 AM ) Jay : I am also showing the tracking reflects delivery for Jan. 2nd . My apologies for that as the meals would be bad if delivered on that day . I &apos;ve gone ahead and reached out to our Delivery Specialist and he &apos;ll be looking into this for us to ensure this doesn &apos;t occur again in any future deliveries ! This would likely be due to the holiday schedule .

For the inconvenience , I &apos;ve gone ahead and issued a refund of $ 19.99 to the CC that was charged . Please allow 3-5 days for that to post back to you . I &apos;ve also covered your next order completely with a $ 59.99 in-house credit . This will automatically apply to your next order and cover the cost .

( 12 : 17 : 39 AM ) Carrie : This is the second time in a row . My order that was supposed to arrive on December 15th didn &apos;t arrive either . Then it showed up on Monday and I had to throw the food away . I would like to know what I need to do to ensure it doesn &apos;t keep happening because I have meals planned for a week and then when they don &apos;t arrive I don &apos;t have time to meal prep and plan for the week .

( 12 : 18 : 43 AM ) Jay : I &apos;ll go ahead and forward your concerns to our Quality Assurance team ! My apologies that this occurred again Carrie and we &apos;ll be working to resolve this for you . Your meals do still have a chance to arrive tonight , and if they do they would be fine to eat .

( 12 : 19 : 26 AM ) Carrie : Okay . Thank you . I do love your meals . If it would be better to change my delivery day I &apos;m open to that option .

( 12 : 19 : 59 AM ) Jay : Our Delivery Specialist may reach out to you after further investigation via email to keep you updated and discuss further action . Thank you for your patience thus far Carrie , and we &apos;ll do our best to handle this for you so you can receive your meals !

( 12 : 28 : 36 AM ) Jay : I &apos;m sorry to hear about that . What meal did you receive that was incorrect ?

( 12 : 28 : 57 AM ) Michelle David : Hi there . I ordered a the tagine and received a sausage penne

( 12 : 29 : 26 AM ) Michelle David : I ’ m vegetarian though

( 12 : 29 : 38 AM ) Jay : Got it .

( 12 : 30 : 12 AM ) Jay : Thank you so much for letting us know . I &apos;ve forwarded this information to our Quality Assurance Team for further investigation and review . While we pride ourselves on high levels of accuracy , when cooking and shipping nearly 700,000 meals per week , mistakes can occasionally happen . We &apos;re always seeking to improve our service !

For the inconvenience Michelle , I &apos;ll be applying a $ 20 in-house credit to your subscription to cover the cost of that meal . This amount will be deducted from your next weekly order .

( 12 : 33 : 57 AM ) Jay : Since I have not heard back from you , I am going to bring this chat to a close . If you need further assistance , you can simply start typing away in your chat window to restart the chat .

( 12 : 32 : 43 AM ) Breana : Are you still there , Jake ?

( 12 : 32 : 54 AM ) Jake Simons : That &apos;s a little ridiculous , honestly . For Thanksgiving I was given the option to select a different date . This isn &apos;t the first time something like this has happened - a delivery being cancelled without notice- I &apos;ll be discontinuing the service effective immediately .

( 12 : 33 : 59 AM ) Breana : I am so sorry to hear that ! Unfortunately , we were at capacity for the available delivery days in your area .

( 12 : 34 : 06 AM ) Breana : I can certainly get that done for you .

( 12 : 34 : 08 AM ) Breana : Could you please verify the phone number associated with the subscription ?

( 12 : 34 : 47 AM ) Jake Simons : So , just no heads up ? No notification ? That &apos;s atrocious customer service .

( 12 : 35 : 28 AM ) Jake Simons : Give a shit , for Christ sake . I &apos;ll cancel on my own . Happy new year .

( 12 : 35 : 36 AM ) Breana : My sincere apologies . You should have received an email with notification . In addition , there is a notification on your meal planner as well.Chat started : 2018-12-30 12 : 30 AM UTC

( 12 : 34 : 29 AM ) KB : My sincerest apologies regarding the confusion for the delivery . There has been a delay in your delivery , which I will be reporting to our Delivery Specialists ! We still have you set in our system as a 12 / 29 delivery , but the good news is that even if the meals arrive tomorrow , they will still be safe to eat ! We do ship out our meals to withstand two days of transit time , and for 12 hours on your doorstep after it is delivered . We frequently test our packages to withstand the full two days , even allowing for extra time . Just as a friendly reminder , we are a weekly billing subscription service by nature , but you can skip weeks , and won &apos;t get charged for the weeks you &apos;ve skipped .

( 12 : 34 : 36 AM ) KB : If the meals are not delivered by 9 PM tomorrow , please reach out !

In the meantime , I have issued a $ 10 in-house credit that will be applied to your next weekly order with us . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically apply toward your next charged order .

( 12 : 36 : 15 AM ) Andrew Latham : The tracking I saw said they would not be delivered until Wednesday . I get this same answer every week . Is there something else that can be done ?

( 12 : 36 : 46 AM ) KB : Ah .

( 12 : 37 : 14 AM ) KB : Also , an in-house credit was added to your subscription to be automatically applied to your next order , in the amount of $ 59.99 . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically apply toward your next charged order .

( 12 : 37 : 24 AM ) KB : As this order was at no charge to you , no refund was issued .

( 12 : 39 : 49 AM ) KB : I have updated that for you .

( 12 : 40 : 09 AM ) KB : As another reminder , with Thursday deliveries you can always skip or edit an order by your weekly deadline and charge date of Saturday by 2 PM PT .

What would help me out a great deal to know right now , would be for me to know how much it is going to cost me , to have one meal each day delivered to me here for &quot; one week &quot; . I do realize that the &quot; type &quot; of meals that I order from your menu for each of the days of that week , will determine how much that this will cost .


Therefore , in your e-mail back to me , if you would please tell me how much that it will cost for me to have just the &apos; normal meals &apos; on your menu delivered here to me each of the &quot; 5 business days &quot; ( Monday through Friday &quot; of each week , I would appreciate this . Knowing this will help me a lot . Thank you .




Sincerely ,
David R. Stull @ ettaman1941 @ gmail.comHello David ,

Thank you so much for reaching out to us , and for your interest in Freshly !

We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day . The prices for the meal plans will vary . We have plans that are for 4 , 6 , 9 , or 12 meals per week . The prices for those plans are $ 49.99 , $ 59.99 , $ 89.99 , and 107.99 per week .

I &apos;m afraid at this time we do not have the option to deliver meals individually every day / Whichever meal plan you have , you will receive all the meals on your chosen delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help you manage a subscription if you decide you &apos;d like to give us a try :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


I hope this helps , David , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

Customer Care SpecialistHello David ,

Thank you for your response !

You are now able to start a subscription ! Delivery can be as early as the beginning of January . Depending on your area , the day can vary as it depends on the capacity of the kitchen . I hope this information helps a bit more !

If you have any other questions , don &apos;t hesitate to ask ! I am always happy to help ! 😃 ​

Thank you for reaching out to us !

I &apos;m so sorry for any confusion in regards to your upcoming order , Cheryl ! I &apos;m absolutely happy to look into this for you , we want all of our customers to have a convenient and worry-free experience ! Cheryl , your meals are still scheduled to arrive on December 15th . It looks like your meals are being shipped out today , so the tracking information is not valid . Once the carrier scans your meals into their facility the tracking information will update with the correct information .

However , if you do not receive your meals by the evening of December 15th , please don &apos;t hesitate to reach out to us . We &apos;d be more than happy to further investigate this for you . Cheryl , we design our packaging to keep your food cold during 2 full days of shipment plus 12 hours on your doorstep .

Just a note : It ’ s pretty common for your gel packs to arrive partially melted . As long as they ’ re cool to the touch , they ’ re all good .

Just as a friendly FYI , ( or reminder if you already knew ! ) we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Saturday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Sunday before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?

cjennings2424 @ gmail.comHello there Carol ,

Thank you for your email this evening , I would be more than happy to lend some assistance with your curiosity about our service !

Our meals are made for a one person serving size , so if you would like to receive meals for just one person , then I would say we are a great fit ! We currently have two meal plans that could work out for you ! Since our meals have a shelf-life of 4 to 5 days , I would recommend either the 4 or 6 meal plan .

We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

Thank you for reaching out to us !

We take allergies very seriously and have a strict process in place when checking for cross-contamination .

While we do not use separate machines or lines , we do sanitize / sterilize our equipment after each use and test them before moving on to prepare another meal . Since we don &apos;t use separate lines for each meal though , we can &apos;t guarantee there wouldn &apos;t be a chance of cross-contamination .

You are certainly more than welcome to double check the ingredients list for each meal by clicking on the meal pictures on our menu ! Below is a helpful link to bring you to our page :

freshly.com / on-the-menu

Currently , we do not have the ability to customize the meals . The meals on our menu will come to you as shown . If you have a very serious food allergy or intolerance , we recommend that you work with your physician to determine if our meals are right for you . Once logged in , we also have a preference center where you can select specific foods you ’ d like to avoid . When viewing the menu , meals containing those ingredients will be indicated by a red exclamation point .

We pride ourselves on high levels of accuracy , however , mistakes can occasionally happen . I &apos;ll certainly be reporting this to our Quality Assurance team . We &apos;re always seeking to improve , so having our customers report such incidents is definitely helpful !

I do apologize , as we only deliver once per week and we are not able to send you the replacement meal , as our kitchen needing 5-6 days to prep the ingredients , cook the meals as they are cooked in batches , package and ship them out . However , to further express my apologies , I &apos;ve gone ahead and issued a refund in the amount of $ 13 ( double the value ) of the adjusted price of the missing meal you did not receive . Please do allow up to 3-5 business days for the funds to post onto your bank account ( depending on your banking institution ) .

Just as a friendly FYI , ( or reminder if you already knew ! ) we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis .

( 02 : 35 : 38 AM ) Alondra : However , I can go ahead and do so for you now .

( 02 : 35 : 42 AM ) Alondra : One moment please .

( 02 : 35 : 56 AM ) Rachel Ross : That would be great if you coukd

( 02 : 36 : 16 AM ) Alondra : You were already charged for 12 meals for your Wednesday , December 19th order , so I am not able to change the meal plan to 9 meals for this order , but I am able to do so for future orders after this week .

( 02 : 36 : 29 AM ) Rachel Ross : Ok thanks

( 02 : 37 : 38 AM ) Alondra : You &apos;re welcome and I will also go ahead and apply an in-house credit in the amount of $ 18 onto your subscription which is the price difference of the 12 meal plan and the 9 meal plan , since you were not able to change it to 9 meals for your Wednesday , December 19th order . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically be applied towards your next charged order .

( 02 : 38 : 16 AM ) Rachel Ross : Oh wow you don ’ t have to do that ! It was my fault ! !

( 02 : 39 : 43 AM ) Alondra : Also , I am only able to edit the 12 meals that you would like to receive for your Wednesday , December 19th order at this time . I do have before 5PM PT tomorrow , as this is my deadline to do so for you on my end . Your weekly deadline is now every Friday before 2PM PT , as we have now opened up our new second kitchen facility in Maryland and now our East Coast customers will be able to have the same deadline time as our current customers that we service now from our Phoenix , Az kitchen .

( 02 : 40 : 30 AM ) Rachel Ross : Oh gosh that deadline seems to be early I will have to make sure and have a habit to be done by Thursday

( 02 : 41 : 16 AM ) Alondra : I certainly understand and do apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you , Rachel ! However , we will now have more time on our end to make any changes needed for you , if you were to miss your deadline on your end .

( 02 : 42 : 07 AM ) Rachel Ross : You guys are very great to work with I do appreciate you . So do I just tell you the meals I want to change to for this week

( 02 : 42 : 44 AM ) Alondra : Thank you for your feedback , Rachel and yes , just go ahead and list the 12 meals that you would like for your Wednesday , December 19th order on this chat and I will go ahead and make the meal changes for you on my end .

( 02 : 55 : 27 AM ) AJ : One moment while I pull up your subscription to look into this for you !

( 02 : 59 : 13 AM ) AJ : Thank you for your patience , Jacinto ! I show that we refunded you very close to the time we charged your card . It &apos;s likely that the initial charge didn &apos;t actually settle , but only your bank would be able to provide you with this information .

( 02 : 59 : 33 AM ) AJ : I suggest reaching out to your bank and asking them to go over your December 2nd transactions on their end .

( 03 : 00 : 14 AM ) Jacinto Colmenero : What is the date of that transaction ?

( 03 : 00 : 24 AM ) AJ : December 2nd .

( 03 : 00 : 54 AM ) Jacinto Colmenero : I checked my account just now and I only see a debit for freshly but not a credit back .

( 03 : 01 : 41 AM ) AJ : Please allow me a few moments to reach out to a supervisor to look deeper into this !

( 03 : 01 : 42 AM ) Jacinto Colmenero : Thank you for the date . I know it ’ s a long shot ... but by chance do you have a transaction number ?

( 03 : 01 : 50 AM ) AJ : That &apos;s what I &apos;m working on ! : )

( 03 : 02 : 16 AM ) Jacinto Colmenero : Ok great . Thank you

( 03 : 08 : 30 AM ) AJ : Thanks again for your patience !

( 03 : 09 : 12 AM ) Jacinto Colmenero : Sure thing . Thanks for the help

( 03 : 09 : 13 AM ) AJ : I spoke with my supervisor and there is no transaction ID for this transaction . However , she confirmed with me that we did refund very close to the charge time so it &apos;s likely the transaction was removed and didn &apos;t settle .

( 03 : 09 : 38 AM ) AJ : I suggest reaching out to your bank and providing them with the email receipt that we sent you about the refund .

( 03 : 10 : 00 AM ) AJ : I &apos;d be happy to have this chat transcript emailed to you when we finish as well .

( 03 : 10 : 21 AM ) Jacinto Colmenero : Okay thanks again for double checking .

Thank you for reaching out and welcome to Freshly !

Just as a friendly FYI , ( or reminder if you already knew ! ) we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Tuesday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Thursday before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


These are just a few of the really helpful links in our FAQ . You can always access even more information from our FAQ page by clicking on the &quot; Help &quot; tab in the upper right hand corner while logged into your account ! And of course , we are always happy to assist via email , text or phone at 844-FRESHLY or via chat ! Our current hours of operation are from 6am-11pm PT every day .

I hope this helps , Dorothy , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

Customer Care SpecialistHi Megan ,

Thank you for the promo code . I went ahead and placed my first order . I just have a couple questions . Why is the delivery so far away ? The earliest option is on January 22nd . If I want to continue with the service , how much time in advance I need to please my order ? I placed the order for 6 meals , am I going to receive two orders of the same 6 meals for two weeks ?


Looking forward to hearing from you !


Best ,
Christian

UnsubscribeHi Christian ,

Thanks for your reply ! Megan is away from her desk but I &apos;d be happy to answer your questions !

I can see from your subscription that you are on the east coast . Our new east coast kitchen is not quite open yet , and would be open starting in January . This would be why your first delivery day is so far out . As your first delivery day gets closer , you &apos;d have the ability to edit your meals for your next order , as you can always see up to three weeks in advanced normally in your meals planner ( you can &apos;t right now since the first order is so far out ) , so no worries there ! Your weekly deadline for making any edits to your subscription , including skipping weeks or editing meals would be every Thursday at 2 PM PST .

I hope you ’ re having a great week ! I saw you canceled your subscription recently because you wanted more meal variety … I ’ m so sorry to hear this !

Since you &apos;ve been gone , we ’ ve added new meals to the menu , like Butternut Squash Risotto , Sausage Baked Penne , and Lebanese-Style Beef Meatballs .

Also , you need not receive meals every single week , but , instead , can skip weeks here and there and come back after we &apos;ve added some new , yummy meals to our menu ! I &apos;d be happy to help arrange this for you , should you be interested .

115 E. 23rd St. , 7th Floor , New York , NY 10010Hello Kristen ,

Thank you for reaching out , and I am so sorry to hear you received an incorrect meal in your first order !

We pride ourselves in the high level of accuracy of our Production Team so I &apos;m sorry to hear about the meal mix-up here . I &apos;ve already notified them about this oversight as well as applied an in-store credit of $ 20 to your subscription ( equal to double the value of your missing Chicken Teriyaki ) . This credit will automatically apply to your next charged order and will be available for up to 6 months until its use .

Just as a friendly FYI , ( or reminder if you already knew ! ) we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Saturday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Monday before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


These are just a few of the really helpful links in our FAQ . You can always access even more information from our FAQ page by clicking on the &quot; Help &quot; tab in the upper right hand corner while logged into your account ! And of course , we are always happy to assist via email , text or phone at 844-FRESHLY or via chat ! Our current hours of operation are from 6am-11pm PT every day .

My sincere apologies for this first experience , Kristen ! I hope this helps , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

Please provide me the entree name you would like to replace the meatballs with , and I will gladly update your Meal Planner . Please respond to this email no later than , Sunday , January 20 before 2PM , as the meals go into production after that time .

( 02 : 47 : 46 AM ) Taylor L. : I &apos;m not currently pulling a subscription up with your information so it &apos;s likely none was created . You should be able to safely restart the sign up process if you &apos;d like .

( 02 : 52 : 17 AM ) Martin : One moment while I pull up your subscription to look into this for you !

( 02 : 55 : 22 AM ) Martin : Sadly , it looks like an unforeseen delay was experienced with our carrier .

( 02 : 55 : 41 AM ) Martin : At this time , it &apos;s safe to assume that these meals won &apos;t be reaching you today .

( 02 : 56 : 05 AM ) Martin : Please know that I have brought this to the attention of our Delivery Specialist and we will do all that we can to stop this delivery .

( 02 : 56 : 41 AM ) Martin : If these meals do happen to reach you on Monday or later , then please dispose of them as they would no longer be fresh or good to enjoy .

( 02 : 56 : 55 AM ) Dustin Weber : My very first order was the same thing . Second order came . I liked your meals . 3rd week order doesn ’ t show again ! It seems I can ’ t count on my food to come on a regular basis .

( 02 : 56 : 58 AM ) Martin : In light of this , I have issued you a full refund of $ 39.00 .

( 02 : 57 : 04 AM ) Martin : Please allow 3-5 business days for that refund to be fully processed and applied back to your card .

( 02 : 57 : 56 AM ) Martin : I have also issued you an in-house credit of $ 20.00 for the inconvenience . Also , your $ 20.99 promo discount is reapplied to the subscription .

( 02 : 58 : 00 AM ) Martin : This is a one-time credit that will automatically be applied to your next charged order , but it does expire in 6 months if not used by then .

( 02 : 58 : 14 AM ) Martin : I &apos;m so very sorry for this experience , Dustin . I definitely understand your frustration .

( 02 : 58 : 38 AM ) Martin : We never intend for any delays to occur , so it &apos;s quite disappointing that this has happened with your delivery again .

( 02 : 58 : 55 AM ) Dustin Weber : Well what ’ s funny is the same thing was done on my first order so I had to chat back in for my discounts to be applied .

( 02 : 59 : 31 AM ) Martin : These discounts will automatically be applied to your next charged order if you decide that you would like another delivery .

( 03 : 00 : 18 AM ) Dustin Weber : Okay sounds good . I have to go but thanks for notating my account !

( 02 : 07 : 29 AM ) Taylor L. : We don &apos;t currently offer macro information for our meals at this time , I &apos;m sorry to say !

( 02 : 07 : 39 AM ) Brandie King : 🤭

( 02 : 07 : 54 AM ) Brandie King : So no nutrient info at all

( 02 : 07 : 54 AM ) Taylor L. : Our overall goal is to provide nutrient-rich dining options that help you eat healthy , feel good , and manage your weight . Chances are , if you are looking for a healthy meal alternative , our service will be a great option for you . All of our meals are gluten-free , peanut-free , packed with natural nutrients , and free of refined sugars .

( 02 : 08 : 13 AM ) Taylor L. : On average , our meals contain about 500 calories or less per entree , with meals as low as 350 calories . We believe that when you ’ re eating the right foods instead of “ empty calories ” from sweeteners and low-quality processed foods , you don ’ t have to worry as much about the number itself .

( 02 : 08 : 28 AM ) Taylor L. : As a point of reference , the current FDA regulations are 300 grams of carbs per day and the average day Freshly meal is about 40 grams , with meals as low as 16 grams .

( 02 : 09 : 07 AM ) Brandie King : I was just hoping they would include carb , fats and protein info per meal

( 02 : 09 : 26 AM ) Taylor L. : You can always click on our meals on our menu and view a breakdown for each meal !

( 02 : 09 : 40 AM ) Brandie King : Ok . Thanks

( 02 : 09 : 41 AM ) Taylor L. : We post our meals nutrition labels for people to review before making a decision to join us .

( 02 : 24 : 04 AM ) KB : Also , an in-house credit was added to your subscription to be automatically applied to your next order , in the amount of $ 30 . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically apply toward your next charged order .

( 02 : 24 : 33 AM ) KB : I &apos;m so sorry about your experience , Daniel !

( 02 : 26 : 39 AM ) Daniel Wynne : That sounds great except you are 0 for 1 on fulfilled orders . This is REALLY disappointing . I work for FEMA and I am currently deployed in California staying in a hotel where meal options are limited , expensive , and not very healthy . I had hoped your service could offer an alternative .

( 02 : 26 : 58 AM ) KB : I &apos;m so very sorry !

( 02 : 27 : 31 AM ) KB : We will certainly be speaking with our delivery specialist about our third-party carriers about this !

( 02 : 27 : 44 AM ) KB : Just as a friendly reminder , we are a weekly billing subscription service by nature , but you can skip weeks , and won &apos;t get charged for the weeks you &apos;ve skipped .

As another reminder , you can always skip or edit an order by your weekly deadline and charge date of Monday by 2 PM PT .

( 02 : 27 : 46 AM ) KB : Is there anything else I can assist you with ?

( 02 : 28 : 34 AM ) Daniel Wynne : So that ’ s it ? This week is a bust ? Better luck next week ?

( 02 : 28 : 50 AM ) KB : I &apos;m so sorry about your experience , Daniel !

( 02 : 28 : 57 AM ) KB : I wish I could do more !

( 02 : 30 : 04 AM ) Daniel Wynne : I already referred 3 other people . Way to embarrass me .

( 02 : 30 : 48 AM ) KB : I &apos;m very sorry , Daniel . As mentioned earlier , I will certainly be speaking with our delivery specialist about our third-party carriers about this !

( 02 : 30 : 50 AM ) KB : Thank you for contacting Freshly ! I &apos;d appreciate your taking our quick survey about your experience once the chat is over !

( 02 : 08 : 04 AM ) Alondra : I certainly understand and please allow me one moment to see if he is available at this time .

( 02 : 08 : 27 AM ) Brian Youngblood : i sent him the emails he requested

( 02 : 08 : 44 AM ) Alondra : Thank you and one moment please .

( 02 : 10 : 00 AM ) Alondra : I do apologize , as Stephen is out of the office at the moment . However , I &apos;d be more than happy to assist you further .

( 02 : 10 : 18 AM ) Alondra : Please allow me one moment to review your previous chat with him .

( 02 : 10 : 37 AM ) Brian Youngblood : Can you access the chat history that I just had with him about 5 minutes ago ?

( 02 : 10 : 45 AM ) Alondra : Yes , one moment please .

( 02 : 10 : 45 AM ) Brian Youngblood : ok great

( 02 : 10 : 49 AM ) Alondra : Thank you !

( 02 : 14 : 51 AM ) Alondra : Thank you for your patience , Brian !

( 02 : 15 : 08 AM ) Alondra : I am now reviewing the emails that you sent to us in regards to the refunds and the credits .

( 02 : 15 : 17 AM ) Alondra : Just bare with me for one moment .

( 02 : 19 : 44 AM ) Alondra : I do see that due to the delay with your Thursday , November 29th order , you were refunded back in the amount of $ 39 and we applied a $ 20 credit which applied towards your Thursday , December 6th order as you were charged $ 39.99 for 6 meals ( regular price is $ 59.99 ) . Due to the delay with your Thursday , December 6th order , you were refunded back the $ 39.99 and we applied a $ 30 credit and this $ 30 credit applied towards your Thursday , December 13th order as you were charged $ 29.99 for this order . Due to the delay with your Thursday , December 13th order , you were refunded back the $ 29.99 and we applied a $ 20 credit onto your subscription and this credit applied towards your Thursday , December 20th order as you were charged $ 39.99 for this order .

( 02 : 23 : 01 AM ) Brian Youngblood : Well here ’ s the deal . This is very confusing I had to pay for any of them , especially the last one considering all the various credits and promotional price of ehe first that got delivered late and was told to discard the box .

( 02 : 23 : 43 AM ) Alondra : However , I do apologize for the oversight of this , as you should have two-full $ 59.99 in-house credits onto your subscription to honor your first week promo discount along with the in-house credits that applied towards your last three orders that you did not receive .

( 02 : 23 : 49 AM ) Brian Youngblood : each email says 100 percent refund .

( 02 : 24 : 11 AM ) Alondra : Yes , so you were refunded back for which you were charged for each order , which was $ 39 , $ 39.99 and $ 29.99 .

( 02 : 24 : 32 AM ) Alondra : So you were refunded back in full for which you were charged for .

( 02 : 24 : 42 AM ) Brian Youngblood : so a charge of 39.99 on December 14 and a credit back on December 14 of 29.99 makes no sense .

( 02 : 25 : 14 AM ) Alondra : However , you should have not been charged for your Thursday , December 20th order and should have been at no additional cost to you .

( 02 : 25 : 15 AM ) Brian Youngblood : sorry 15 refund and charge on 14

( 02 : 25 : 31 AM ) Alondra : I do apologize , as you were not refunded back $ 15 for an order .

( 02 : 25 : 48 AM ) Alondra : You were refunded back the amount that you were charged for each of your first three orders that were delayed .

( 02 : 25 : 48 AM ) Brian Youngblood : again very confusing I should have paid for anything .

( 02 : 26 : 45 AM ) Alondra : I certainly understand and do apologize for any confusion this may have caused you !

( 02 : 26 : 57 AM ) Alondra : Give me one moment to review this further with my supervisor .

( 02 : 27 : 51 AM ) Brian Youngblood : if all three are refunded , what about the last one . If all the credits given were applied that should have at least covered the last one .

( 02 : 28 : 05 AM ) Alondra : One moment please .

( 02 : 28 : 47 AM ) Brian Youngblood : I must go now . Please send me an email . Thank you .

( 02 : 29 : 04 AM ) Alondra : I just spoke with my supervisor and I will be refunding you back in full for your Thursday , December 20th order which you were charged $ 39.99 .

( 02 : 29 : 16 AM ) Alondra : Which you should have not been charged for.Hello Brian ,

I hope this email finds you well !

I wanted to go ahead and follow up with you in regards to the refunds and in-house credits that have been issued !

Due to the delay with your first initial order which was on Thursday , November 29th you were charged $ 39 for this order when you initially signed up on Sunday , November 11th . On Friday , November 30th at 8 : 44am MST we went ahead and refunded you back in full in the amount of $ 39 and we also applied a $ 20 in-house credit onto your subscription for the inconvenience to automatically apply towards your next charged order . On Friday , November 30th at 6 : 26pm MST you were charged in the amount of $ 39.99 for your Thursday , December 6th order . Due to the delay with this order , on Friday , November 30th at 10 : 38pm MST you were refunded back in full in the amount of $ 39.99 and we had applied a $ 30 in-house credit onto your subscription for the inconvenience to automatically apply towards your next charged order . On Friday , December 7th at 6 : 28pm MST you were charged in the amount of $ 29.99 as the $ 30 in-house credit had applied towards this order . Due to the delay with this order , on Friday , December 14th at 7 : 44am MST you were refunded back in full in the amount of $ 29.99 for which you were charged for and we had applied a $ 20 in-house credit onto your subscription for the inconvenience . The $ 20 in-house credit that was applied on Friday , December 14th automatically applied towards your Thursday , December 20th order as you were charged $ 39.99 for this order on Friday , December 14th at 3 : 02pm MST .

Due to the delays with your first three orders , you should have instead been given two full in-house credits and not been charged for your Thursday , December 13th ( which was refunded ) or your Thursday , December 20th orders . I &apos;ve now gone ahead and issued a refund in the amount of $ 39.99 back to your card on file for which you were charged for your Thursday , December 20th order . Please do allow up to 3-5 business days for the funds to post onto your bank account ( depending on your banking institution ) .

I ’ ve also gone ahead and applied a ( 100 % ) in-house credit in the amount of $ 59.99 onto your subscription to honor your first $ 20 and second $ 30 in-house credits and this $ 59.99 credit will automatically be applied towards your next open order at no additional cost to you . In addition , I &apos;ve also applied another in-house credit in the amount of $ 20 onto your subscription to honor your first week promo discount that you had initially signed up with . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically be applied towards your next charged order .

I hope this helps Brian , and if you should need anything further , please reach out , as I &apos;m always happy to help !

Thanks for reaching out to us today .

I &apos;m very sorry to say it looks like there was an unexpected delay in your delivery and it wouldn &apos;t have arrived to you within a safe time-frame . Fedex reached out to us and informed us of this issue on December 22nd , those meals have been destroyed so they won &apos;t arrive to you spoiled and we immediately applied a refund of $ 59.99 to your card on file with us , please allow 3-5 business days for this to process .

I &apos;m so very sorry for this issue and we &apos;re working closely with our carriers to ensure things like this won &apos;t happen again in the future . With the passing of the Holiday season deliveries should proceed without issue once again .

I hope this helps , Michael , and please don &apos;t hesitate to reach out with any questions or concerns you may have .

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! that was last week and threw those meals out but I didn &apos;t get any this week either



&quot; how &apos;s that working for you &quot; Hi Michael ,

Thank you for the prompt reply .

I &apos;m so sorry for that confusion . We are unable to make any deliveries this week of December 28th and next week of January 4th as we are experiencing shortened production weeks while we allow our production team time off to spend with their families for the holidays . This was reflected in your Meal Planner 3 weeks in advance with the status of &quot; Not Available &quot; and &quot; Not Scheduled &quot; displayed on those two days . I &apos;m so sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you . You , of course , were not charged for those weeks .

I hope this helps clarify , Michael , and as always I &apos;m always here to help or answer any questions you may have .

( 03 : 07 : 13 AM ) Alondra : Give me one moment please .

( 03 : 08 : 07 AM ) Alondra : I do apologize , but the email address that you provided on this chat which is saho6514 @ gmail.com . This subscription has been cancelled for over 2 years now .

( 03 : 08 : 15 AM ) Sam : samuel.holz @ adp.com

( 03 : 08 : 21 AM ) Alondra : Okay , thank you .

( 03 : 10 : 29 AM ) Sam : ?

( 03 : 11 : 31 AM ) Alondra : I &apos;m terribly sorry , but due to the major holidays , we were unable to deliver to you for Saturday , December 29th . Since no alternative date was chosen this week was set as skipped automatically and you were not charged for this week .

( 03 : 12 : 25 AM ) Sam : this is the third time in about a month this has happened and is a huge inconveience and costs me time and money because I now have no time to do grocery shopping because I was relying on freshly to deliver the meals you said you would

( 03 : 12 : 57 AM ) Sam : i need you to correspond with a manager and let them know that if my next two freshly orders are not delivered , FREE OF CHARGE , I will be leaving this service for another before the end of the weekend

( 03 : 13 : 09 AM ) Sam : please let me know if this can be done or if I will be terminating the service

( 03 : 13 : 32 AM ) Alondra : I certainly understand and do apologize once again ! We do forecast up to 3 weeks in advance and on Saturday , December 1st showed in your meal planner that you were skipped for Saturday , December 29th and you would have been given the option to choose an alternative date to still receive your meals on for this week ..

( 03 : 13 : 56 AM ) Sam : I never elected to skip this saturday

( 03 : 13 : 58 AM ) Sam : that is incorrect

( 03 : 14 : 04 AM ) Alondra : Give me one moment to speak with my supervisor .

( 03 : 14 : 24 AM ) Sam : if it did your site did it automatically , and sent me no proactive notification letting me know I would need to find different means for food this week

( 03 : 14 : 44 AM ) Sam : on none of the three occasions have I received any kind of email heads up that there was going to be issues

( 03 : 17 : 03 AM ) Alondra : As stated , we do forecast up to 3 weeks in advance and you are able to plan ahead 3 weeks in advance as on Saturday , December 1st shown that Saturday , December 29th was skipped in your meal planner as we were not able to deliver to you for this date due to the holidays and also due our kitchen being closed . However , I &apos;d be more than happy to pass along your feedback over to our marketing team for further review in regards to sending out emails when major holidays interfere with our kitchens schedule .

( 03 : 17 : 39 AM ) Alondra : I spoke with my supervisor and since you are a loyal customer with us , the most that I can do is provide a $ 59.99 in-house credit onto your subscription for the inconvenience of this .

( 03 : 17 : 56 AM ) Alondra : This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically be applied towards your next charged order at no additional cost to you .

( 03 : 18 : 36 AM ) Sam : Ok . From no on , some kind of text or email notifications would be greatly apprecaited

( 03 : 18 : 57 AM ) Sam : I do not log on regularly to a freshly account to check in ... I log in once a week , pick the food , and expect the food to be delivered

( 03 : 19 : 07 AM ) Sam : if this is not going to happen , you should proactively notify your customers

( 03 : 19 : 54 AM ) Alondra : I &apos;ve gone ahead and passed your feedback along to our marketing and they will go ahead and review this further , as I cannot guarantee of the time-frame on which they will sending out emails to customers in regards to major holidays and our kitchens schedule due to those major holidays .

( 03 : 21 : 33 AM ) Sam : it has happened either 3 or 4 times now

( 03 : 22 : 34 AM ) Alondra : I do apologize , but I see that since you been with us , we were not able to deliver to you for the week of Thanksgiving and now for the week of Christmas .

Thank you for your reply and for the information !

We pride ourselves on high levels of accuracy , however , mistakes can occasionally happen . I &apos;ll certainly be reporting this to our Quality Assurance team . We &apos;re always seeking to improve , so having our customers report such incidents is definitely helpful !

To further express my apologies , I &apos;ve gone ahead and applied an in-house credit in the amount of $ 20 ( double the value ) of the missing meal you did not receive . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically be applied towards your next charged order .

Customer Care SpecialistOut of the 6 meals I ordered , only 4 arrived despite the invoice stating I should &apos;ve recieved all 6 . I did not receive the two ( 2 ) sausage Baked Penne with Sauteed Zucchini and Spinach for this order . Please advise or refund .

Please do not offer to put toward my &quot; next &quot; order as I will be cancelling after Mondays shipment arrives , which I have already been charged for .

If you have any further questions please feel free to try to contact me at : 909.731.8012


Thank you ,

Thank you for reaching out to us !

I &apos;m so very sorry to hear that you did not receive those meals as shown in your invoice ! It is very unusual for there to be any such problems and I want to assure you that I will report the incident to our Quality Assurance team so they can investigate further . We are always seeking to improve our service and pride ourselves on high levels of accuracy , so the fact that you did not receive a proper order is very disappointing to us !

For this error , I have issued a refund of $ 20 for those meals that were not received . Please be aware that it can take 3-5 business days to complete on your end . Also , you did state you would be cancelling ! Did you want me to cancel your subscription now to prevent any future charges and deliveries ?

My sincere apologies again for the trouble , Heather , and if you have any further questions or concerns , please feel free to reach out to me !

Thank you for your response , Alex is currently out of the office , but rest assured that I am here to assist !

With that said , my apologies for the confusion , as you would have wanted to skip , cancel , or contact us prior to your deadline to have avoided receiving this order . Your deadline to make this request happen in time should have been on Monday , December 24th . Seeing as you receive this shipment at a discounted rate , we are unable to process a refund since you did receive the shipment .

I will be sure to provide your feedback to our quality assurance team . As requested , I can confirm that your subscription is canceled , you will no longer receive any further charges or deliveries unless you chose to reactivate

Once again , my sincerest apologies for the confusion . If you should need anything further , please reach out , as I &apos;m always happy to help !

We wanted to order 1-3 months of meals for 6 days a week as a gift for grandparents .

The dietary constraint is that it needs to be low sodium and not high fat .

Is there a way to do this where the meals are automatically selected with variety ( instead of us selecting ) ?

Please advise .

Thanks ,

PrairHello Prair ,

Thank you so much for reaching out to us , and for your interest in Freshly !

We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day . If you do not select new meals , and make no new selections , your default delivery is sent . When an older meal that is on your default delivery , is no longer available on the menu , we will send a new item .

At this time , we do not have an option to automatically send a new variety each delivery , if no new selections are made . I am so sorry if this causes an inconvenience , Prair ! Good news ! We typically project 3 weeks in advance so that you can pre-select meals for those shipments , and then sign back in at a later date to select more for future deliveries .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to make any new elections by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help you manage a subscription if you decide you &apos;d like to give us a try :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


As a little background , we create our menu around nutrient-dense veggies , high-quality proteins , and healthy fats , and season our meals using sea salt , herbs , and spices . We never use flavor enhancers or other artificial ingredients that can drive unhealthy levels of sodium .

The sodium in our meals is a combo of sodium that ’ s naturally occurring in the ingredients themselves ( a medium carrot has about 50 mg of sodium alone ! ) , and a mineral-dense sea salt that we use to season our meals . ( We encourage our customers to add any additional seasonings based on their personal preferences . )

Our meals average about 700 mg of sodium per dish , which is less than a third of the FDA ’ s daily recommendation of 2,300 mg . We always offer a range of dishes under 600 mg .

We work hard to offer a better , fresher alternative to other convenience-type or packaged foods that are high in sodium . For example , our Sicilian-Style Chicken Parm contains about 580 mg of sodium , while a similar dish at a local chain restaurant may contain between 2,500-3,000 mg of sodium .

We recently launched a sort feature in the top righthand corner of the &quot; Choose Meals &quot; page so you can sort by sodium , from lowest to highest ( some of our meals are as low as 300-400 mg ) . This tool is useful if you have a specific nutritional preference or goal in mind . However , if you have any pre-existing medical conditions , we do recommend that you work with your doctor or nutritionist to determine what meals are right for you .

Your nutrition / ingredient-related question _ ( s ) might be better answered by one of our Wellness Experts ; they have educational backgrounds in nutrition and will be able to answer your question _ ( s ) more thoroughly . With dietary needs and preferences , especially concerning medical needs , we want to be sure you have the best information we can provide !

If you would be open to speaking with one of these Freshly Wellness Experts , you can easily schedule a call using this link : https : / / calendly.com / freshlywellness

I hope that this was helpful , Prair . Please let me know if I can answer any additional questions , and have a great day !

Thank you for your response !

I do apologize , as due to the holidays as Christmas being on Tuesday , December 26th , we were not able to deliver to you for Wednesday , December 26th . I also see that for Wednesday , January 2nd , we are not able to deliver to you as New Year &apos;s is on Tuesday , January 1st and since these are both holidays , our kitchen will be closed and the carriers are also not delivering as your meals ship out on Tuesday &apos;s . This was outlined throughout your meal planner , as we do forecast up to 3 weeks in advance and these weeks were shown in your meal planner on Saturday , December 1st for your Wednesday , December 26th order and on Saturday , December 8th for your Wednesday , January 2nd order . However , I sincerely apologize of any of this was missed and your next scheduled delivery is set for Wednesday , January 9th .

Once again , my sincerest apologies Joseph ! If you should need further assistance , please reach out , as I am always happy to help !

Customer Care SpecialistTotally unacceptable . I should ’ ve been offered options . Just to assume that I looked at whatever you are referring to is an assumption with no basis . Posting things on the Internet and assuming that I will see them is silly . When you want to solicit business from my friends or otherwise contact me there ’ s no problem with the email and I don ’ t see why I was not timely notified . For What it ’ s worth I ’ m going to start checking with your competitors . I am single and if I didn ’ t want to order the food I would not of signed up to start with . I don ’ t care when the holidays are you should ’ ve made an accommodation and ship the day early or a day later whatever . Very poor business model

Customer Care SpecialistThis email is as unacceptable as the first one . How can you improve the business model when you don ’ t care about your customers ? Whoever instituted this ridiculous policy of secret non-delivery should be terminated immediately . I will not be recommending anyone else to freshly and I strongly suggest that my emails be turned over to corporate and someone who has half a brain .

Customer Service LeadDon ’ t misunderstand me while I appreciate the credit , as a single person you have now thrown a monkey wrench into my plans and forced me to do marketing etc . The whole purpose of my using your service is to avoid that . Telling me that I ’ m not going to have food for three weeks is ridiculous . Why aren ’ t you offering to move my delivery date or whatever is necessary to get me food ? I don ’ t know who runs your company , but as a business lawyer for over 40 years I can tell you that if I were involved they would be terminated .

Thank you for your valued feedback !

My apologies for not offer another delivery date earlier . We are able to offer an early date for January , 7th , but as I mentioned , there sadly would be no way to provide an earlier delivery date than what is readily available for you to review on your meal planner . I truly wish there was more than I could do for you , but at this time , the date provided as well as the in-house credit would be the only accommodation I can provide .

We thank you for your business , and if there is anything else we can do to assist , let me know !

Customer Service LeadAs I said , totally unacceptable . I don ’ t understand how you are still in business . I ’ m going to start looking at your competitors . I really don ’ t think at my age I need to be running to supermarkets because you guys don ’ t know how to plan for the holiday season . First you missed two deliveries and now this . It ’ s absolutely amazing to me that your company is still in business . Offering me the food one day earlier doesn ’ t cut it . If I can ’ t get any food delivered on Monday I ’ m going to check the competitors and find a company that doesn ’ t abandon the customer .

My apologies to hear of your continued frustration .

As I have stated , I understand the inconvenience this has caused . I have looked into providing you with an earlier delivery date , but as mentioned , our carriers , as well as our production facility , have limited availability during the weeks that the holidays land on .

Since I am unable to offer an early shipment , seeing your loyalty with us is greatly appreciated , I have provided a full in-house credit of $ 49.99 . That would be the most that I can do at this time , I wish there was more I could do in getting an order out to you sooner .

Let us know if there would be anything else that we can assist with tonight !

Customer Service LeadFirst , despite the tone of my emails I do not blame you personally . That having been said your company has zero chance of success . I assume that most of your customers are like me – too busy to run to the supermarket on a business day . It is the obligation of the business to take care of the customers not the other way around . $ 50 is what we called , back in the day , chump change . What is the point ? Am I going to be able to hire someone to go to the market and cook ? Ridiculous .

I suggest you get someone in upper management to contact me in order to keep my business and the business of the people that I refer . Virtually daily one of my clients asks me about this service . You can imagine what I ’ m going to tell them now . If someone cannot figure out a way to get me food on Monday I will have to find a competitor . I cannot believe that your company does not have an emergency back up system for situations like this . Clearly whoever runs the company has zero idea of how a business should be professionally operated and is apparently only concerned with the cost . Not a recipe for long-term success . Before I have to post this on Yelp , I expect to hear from someone in authority . If not I am going to go on the Internet and explain how I have been treated .

I hope this message finds you well . My name is Amy and I am one of the Supervisors here at Freshly . I wanted to reach out to offer my sincere apologies for the inconvenience that has been caused due to a regular order not being able to be sent to you this or next week due to the holidays .

During holiday weeks , we do have a shortened production schedule as we close down our kitchen facility in order to give our extremely hard-working kitchen team some time off to spend with their families . Due to this , we are not able to offer as many delivery day options for specific weeks . On top of this , the third-party carriers we use also do not work on certain days during holiday weeks , rendering it impossible for us to get orders sent out for particular days . Since your orders for this week and next week fall on days just after major holidays , your regular delivery day of Wednesday was not an available option . We know that our customers have busy schedules and do not ever want to catch someone by surprise by completely changing their delivery day on our end and having orders show up unexpectedly . We do , however , offer alternate delivery days ( as many as are available ) depending on the production capacity for each particular area as well as the carrier . These alternate days can be selected in your Meal Planner and can be viewed up to 3 weeks in advance .

I have reached out to our Delivery Specialist and it looks like we should actually be able to send you a free replacement order to be delivered on January 5th . I do hope that this date works better for you and if it does , please let me know at your earliest convenience so we can try and set that up .

To further express my apologies for the trouble , I have gone ahead and issued you a full refund for the $ 49.99 you were charged for your last delivered order . Please allow up to 5 business days for this refund to post back to your bank account , depending on your bank . You will also receive a separate confirmation email in regards to that refund just so you have that for your records . You will still have that $ 49.99 in-house credit on your subscription to cover your next order charge to be processed as well . That credit will be automatically applied for you and will expire after 6 months if not used .

Thank you so much for your time and for your patience , Joseph ! I look forward to hearing back from you .

Customer Service SupervisorI give up . I have advised small businesses for 40 years and I rarely see such ridiculous comments . The problem that you have is that your excuses are of your own making . It ’ s your responsibility to contact the customer and warn them of your supply / manufacturer / delivery issues . It ’ s not my obligation to call you up and ask you if I ’ m going to get my food . Exactly where am I supposed to do for the next eight days ? Why is this my problem instead of yours ? Why can ’ t you plan ? Why do you bother me with ridiculous emails , but when something important comes up like you shutting down with no warning to me , that I don ’ t get an email about . What good does it do me to get the food to days early ? What happens to the days that I don ’ t get next week ?

Just go ahead and send my delivery anyway you want to whenever you want to , which is apparently your business model anyway , and I ’ m going to go check the competitors and find one that doesn ’ t abandon their customers and hope that they will put up with any abuse . File reflects that your company had already missed two deliveries to me in the past , and this fiasco is the third in however long I have been a customer . Not very long .
I cannot believe that no one is getting food next week and that your company does not plan for any contingencies and just hopes for the best .

I will absolutely be passing along your feedback in regards to sending emails out when we are unable to offer your regular delivery day for the week during the holidays . Hopefully , this is something we can implement in the very near future .

If you would like to receive a free replacement order on January 5th , I would be happy to set that up for you . Otherwise , you are scheduled to receive your next order on January 9th .

I have waited anxiously for my meals to arrive and chose 12 / 29 as my first delivery date a couple weeks ago . I am a little disappointed considering FedEx did not drop off today , their tracking saying Monday end of day . I am completely aware of the holiday and how that may shift the delivery date , but I never received any notification that there would be a delay . The biggest bummer is the day it ’ s going to be delivered I ’ m not there ( I send it to my work address ) .


I am still so excited to try out this service , but just wanted to let y ’ all know . I hope that in the future there will be more notice stating things may be delayed .


Thank you so much for reading !

115 E. 23rd St. , 7th Floor , New York , NY 10010Hi there Kellyn ,

Thank you for reaching out to us !

I &apos;m so very sorry for this experience , but I can certainly assist ! Looking at the tracking information , it appears that your meals are on the FedEx vehicle for delivery . However , the tracking indicates that your meals won &apos;t be delivered until the next business day ( just like you mentioned ) . Sadly , these meals would no longer be fresh or good to enjoy if they are delivered on Monday or later . Rest assured that I have brought this to the attention of our Delivery Specialist for further investigation . We will do all that we can to get this delivery stopped , so that you don &apos;t receive bad meals ! If these meals do happen to reach you on Monday or later , then please dispose of them .

Typically , FedEx does not deliver to businesses on Saturday , so that might be what prevented them from making your delivery . We want all customers to have a convenient and worry-free experience , so it &apos;s certainly disappointing that your delivery didn &apos;t reach you . We never intend for any delays to occur ! In light of this , I have issued you a full refund of $ 39.00 . Please allow 3-5 business days for the refund to be fully processed and applied back to your card . I have also issued you a full in-house credit of $ 59.99 for this inconvenience ( includes first week of promo discount ) . This is a one-time credit that will automatically be applied to your next charged order , but it does expire in 6 months if not used by then .

As a friendly reminder , we are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week ! Sunday by 2PM PT would be your weekly deadline for making updates or skipping a delivery , since your deliveries are on Friday .

Kellyn , please let me know if you have any questions or if I may be of any further assistance . Have a great evening !



Fresh wishes ,
Martin M.

Customer Care SpecialistMartin ! You ’ re an angel ! I would have truly not known that it would actually be out of date ! And , noted on the business not being delivered on Saturdays , I truly want my days to be Fridays , which is on my account .

You are so sweet to have processed the refund and the credit was above and beyond . I truly appreciate the attentiveness to the matter .


Have a wonderful evening as well . Looking forward to my first week ! !


Truly , so so so sweet of you ( and the freshly crew ) .


Best ,
Kellyn

Thank you so much for the reply .

I &apos;m so very sorry for your experience with that delivery but I &apos;m so very happy we were able to make it right and make you happy !

I can confirm your default delivery day is set for every Friday , however your January 12th delivery is scheduled for a Saturday . Please let us know if you &apos;d like that changed ! You can also do so on your end by logging in and selecting that date in your Meal Planner and click &quot; Change &quot; next to the delivery date listed at the top of the menu . You can make this change until Monday , January 7th at 2PM PST .

Just as a friendly FYI , ( or reminder if you already knew ! ) we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Friday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Sunday before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


These are just a few of the really helpful links in our FAQ . You can always access even more information from our FAQ page by clicking on the &quot; Help &quot; tab in the upper right hand corner while logged into your account !

( 03 : 43 : 50 AM ) Stephen : Hi Amanda !

( 03 : 43 : 56 AM ) Stephen : Just a moment please !

( 03 : 44 : 31 AM ) Stephen : We portion as follows :

Main protein source - about 5 ounces

Sides - about 3-4 ounces each

Meals are 13.6 ounces total , on average !

( 03 : 45 : 04 AM ) Amanda : Is there an option for a meal for 2 throughout the week ?

( 03 : 45 : 23 AM ) Stephen : Freshly currently offers four different meal plans for 4 , 6 , 9 , and 12 meals per week .

( 03 : 45 : 27 AM ) Stephen : These are priced at $ 49.99 , $ 59.99 , $ 89.99 , and $ 107.99 , respectively . Your plan of choice will arrive in a single shipment each week .

( 03 : 46 : 06 AM ) Stephen : It depends on how often you are wanting to consume the meals per week , but for 2 people you would get 3 meals each a week if you went with the 6 meal plan !

( 03 : 48 : 05 AM ) Amanda : Okay ! I appreciate your help !

Sent from my iPhoneHi Valerie ,

Thanks for reaching out to us today !

I &apos;m happy to help with this ! I &apos;ve gone ahead and made sure that you &apos;re on the 4 meal plan moving forward , starting with your Saturday , January 5th delivery .

I wanted to let you know that in addition to making the meal plan change in your Subscription Settings ( like you &apos;ve done ) , each delivery week in the Meal Planner that is currently view-able would also need to be updated for it to take effect immediately . You can find the green &quot; Change &quot; link next to where it shows &quot; 6 Meals &quot; in the top left of each delivery week . This is how you would update from week to week . No worries though , I &apos;ve gone ahead and done that for you as well .

I wanted to provide you with a little link that includes a handy video tutorial on how to update your meal plan , just in case you decide to make that change in the future :

How do I change the number of meals in my plan ?

I hope this helps , Valerie , and please don &apos;t hesitate to reach out with any questions or concerns . I &apos;m happy to help ! Have a great week and a safe , happy new year !

UnsubscribeHey Carolyn ,

Thanks for reaching out and your interest in Freshly !

We do deliver to your area and I can see that the first available delivery date is currently Monday , January 7th . Spots fill up fast so make sure you hurry !

Just to give you a little more info on what we do , we are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help you manage a subscription if you decide you &apos;d like to give us a try :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


We believe in a modern approach to health that includes eating real , whole foods . Many processed and packaged foods contain artificial and chemical ingredients that may be harmful to our health . We have a strict banned ingredients list , which includes artificial ingredients , refined sugar , hydrogenated oils , and more ( read about our philosophy in the link below ) .

What is Freshly &apos;s Philosophy on Nutrition ?

Our meals are created around incorporating nutrient-dense veggies , high-quality proteins , and healthy fats into balanced meals that are both wholesome and tasty ( because food that ’ s good for you should taste good , too ! ) .

When it comes to nutrition , we offer a wide range of protein , carbs , fats , and sodium to fit the preferences of many different customers — so we don ’ t design our menu to strictly fit one specific diet . Instead , we offer dishes that fall into categories ( like vegetarian , high protein , paleo friendly ) that we label on our website so you can easily find the meals that suit your needs .

If you have specific needs feel free to let us know and we can see if we have meals that will work for you !

I hope this helps , Carolyn , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

Customer Care SpecialistHello , We love our Freshly but need to make a break this coming Saturday . We have been out of town and are now backed up with meals ! Please do not deliver on Saturday , January 5 , 2019 . We will continue on Jan.12 , 2019 .


Thank you ,
Lori FrankeHi there Lori ,

Thank you for reaching out to us !

My apologies for any inconvenience , but I can certainly assist ! At this time , I can confirm that your delivery for Saturday , January 05 , is skipped . Your very next delivery is scheduled to reach you on Saturday , January 12 . If you do have a lot of meals on hand , then you are able to freeze some of them before their use-by date , so that you have some additional time to eat them . By freezing the meals they will be good for an additional 2 weeks ! When ready to enjoy , you simply need to add a couple of minutes to the heating time and reheat from frozen , without thawing . We recommend confirming that the food is reheated to 165 degrees , the same as reheating from fresh !

As a friendly reminder , we are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week ! Monday by 2PM PT would be your weekly deadline for making updates or skipping a delivery , since your deliveries are on Saturday .

Lori , please let me know if you have any questions or if I may be of any further assistance . Have a great evening !



Fresh wishes ,

Customer Care SpecialistDo you provide dairy and soy free meals ? If so is there limited selections ?


Thanks ,


MeganHello Megan ,

Thank you for reaching out today with your question ! I &apos;m happy to help .

In order to help you find what you ’ re looking for , we launched a sort tool on the “ change meals ” page where you can sort by nutritional attributes and find meals that meet your specific needs . Our meals also have badges on them that indicate if they ’ re paleo-friendly , vegetarian , soy-free , dairy-free , contain fewer than 500 calories , contain fewer than 35 grams of carbs , or contain high-protein ingredients . You can view a particular meals badges or the ingredients by selecting the meal from our website for details about it .

However , if you have any pre-existing medical conditions , we do recommend that you work with your doctor or nutritionist to determine what meals are right for you .

We love to keep things fresh ! We launch a new meal every week and regularly rotate meals on the menu while maintaining customer favorites . Plus , we use our customers ’ meal ratings and comments to revamp current meals to make them even better . Sometimes we even premiere two new meals in a given week just to keep it interesting ! This would either involve adding in a completely new meal or revamping a pre-existing meal to make it even more delicious . We do not have a set amount of soy / dairy free meals per week .

Your nutrition / ingredient-related question _ ( s ) might be better answered by one of our Wellness Experts ; they have educational backgrounds in nutrition and will be able to answer your question _ ( s ) more thoroughly . With dietary needs and preferences , especially concerning medical needs , we want to be sure you have the best information we can provide !

If you would be open to speaking with one of these Freshly Wellness Experts , you can easily schedule a call using this link : https : / / calendly.com / freshlywellness

I hope that this was helpful , Megan . Please let me know if I can answer any additional questions , and have a great day !

Promotions a … Hi Danielle ,

Thank you for reaching out to us !

I do apologize for any confusion in regards to when your shipment would arrive ! I &apos;m afraid that due to the fact that we use a third party carrier , we are unable to pinpoint a specific time as to when your package will be dropped off . This is simply due to logistics such as where you are located on their route and how many deliveries they have will fluctuate from week to week . Our carriers give us a window of time that a package can be delivered anywhere from 9 am to 11 pm . However , what &apos;s great is that you don &apos;t even need to be home to receive your shipment ! Our packaging is able to withstand two full days of transit , plus twelve hours at your door . Plus , we don &apos;t require a signature for the package to be delivered !

I apologize again that I &apos;m unable to tell you what time your order will be delivered , but I hope this helps ! If you have any additional questions or concerns , please feel free to reach back out to me !

KrisHello Kris ,

Thank you for reaching out to us today ! You certainly can ! You would have to create the subscription yourself and choose the meals but enter her delivering address instead of yours . The meals are already prepared so they would only need to heat them and enjoy , each meal has it &apos;s own heating instructions via the microwave .

Below I &apos;ve added a helpful link on how to get the subscription started , just for reference . If you need any further assistance don &apos;t bother on asking :

Customer Care SpecialistHi , just curious . The meals are for 2 people correct ? So the $ 59.99 for 6 meals - feeds 2 people ?

If I order tonight I can get 2 sets at $ 39.99 ?

ChrisHi Chris ,

Thanks for reaching out !

We appreciate you &apos;re interest with Freshly ! The promo is for your first two initial weeks to get $ 20 off each week . This would make your first two initial weeks at $ 39.99 . However each meal is per person . So if you order the 6 meal plan and there are two people then each person per week would get 3 meals .

I hope this information was helpful . Please feel free to reach out !

( 01 : 01 : 25 AM ) Taylor L. : Hello Shelly , thanks for reaching out .

( 01 : 01 : 28 AM ) Taylor L. : One moment while I pull up your subscription to look into this for you !

( 01 : 03 : 41 AM ) Taylor L. : There was a promotion on your subscription for $ 30 off your first two orders with us , as there was an issue with your first order we reissued that promotional value of $ 14.99 as an in-store credit on your account . When you were charged both that and your promotional code applied and discounted your order by $ 29.98 .

( 01 : 04 : 59 AM ) Shelley Tang : Don ’ t understand plus I didn ’ t received any order

( 01 : 05 : 34 AM ) Taylor L. : You didn &apos;t receive an order Friday , December 21st ?

( 01 : 05 : 51 AM ) Shelley Tang : No

( 01 : 05 : 57 AM ) Taylor L. : I &apos;m so sorry about that .

( 01 : 07 : 04 AM ) Taylor L. : So you didn &apos;t receive your Friday , December 7th delivery with us and that order was refunded the $ 45 you paid . So you didn &apos;t lose out on your promotional code we issued that value of $ 14.99 as an in-store credit . This automatically applied to that December 21st order in addition to your promo code of $ 14.99 off your second week of meals . This is why you were charged $ 30.01 instead of $ 45 .

( 01 : 07 : 57 AM ) Shelley Tang : Ok how does this deal with I didn ’ t received the order

( 01 : 08 : 17 AM ) Taylor L. : It seems our carriers may be having issues delivering to your address for some reason . Is there another address you &apos;d like to use for future orders with us ? I will , of course , issue you a full in-store credit of $ 59.99 for this order plus an additional $ 14.99 in-store credit .

( 01 : 08 : 51 AM ) Taylor L. : This situation has been reported to our Delivery Specialist for further investigation if needed .

( 01 : 10 : 13 AM ) Shelley Tang : Nope . Is it okay I can cancel it ? I am out of state right now

( 01 : 10 : 25 AM ) Taylor L. : Certainly .

( 01 : 11 : 11 AM ) Taylor L. : I &apos;ve added a full in-house credit in the amount of $ 59.99 to your subscription plus an additional in-house credit of $ 14.99 , which will be automatically applied to your next open order with us and will remain active on your subscription until six months from today &apos;s date .

( 01 : 11 : 16 AM ) Taylor L. : I can confirm for you that your subscription is cancelled . You will not have any additional payments unless you choose to reactivate your subscription in the future .

( 01 : 11 : 19 AM ) Taylor L. : We do hope you will consider joining us again sometime in the future . We are always seeking to improve our service and are constantly adding new , delicious meals .

( 01 : 12 : 01 AM ) Shelley Tang : thanx

( 01 : 12 : 12 AM ) Taylor L. : My pleasure , Shelley , and I &apos;m sorry again for these delivery issues .

( 01 : 12 : 14 AM ) Taylor L. : Is there anything else I can assist you with ?

( 01 : 13 : 04 AM ) Shelley Tang : How long will I received the payment

( 01 : 13 : 49 AM ) Taylor L. : It was issued as an in-store credit , not a refund . I can issue a refund of $ 30.01 for what you paid and apply an in-store credit of $ 29.98 to your subscription for the promotion used .

( 01 : 15 : 29 AM ) Shelley Tang : Ok

( 01 : 15 : 54 AM ) Taylor L. : I &apos;ve gone ahead and issued that refund in the amount of $ 30.01 to the Venmo that we have on file for you . Please allow 3-5 business days for that refund to be fully processed and applied back to your account .

( 01 : 16 : 32 AM ) Shelley Tang : Ok

( 01 : 19 : 41 AM ) Alondra : I also see that when you had changed your default delivery address in your subscription settings only a few times on Monday , December 17th order , your Sunday , December 30th order delivery address was still set to the 271 delivery address and was not also updated at the time of change , as it is a two-step process when making the default delivery address change in your subscription settings .

( 01 : 20 : 33 AM ) Cesar Cortez : Why is it so difficult to get the address changed ? I feel like any other service would update it immediately to service the next shipment placed .

( 01 : 21 : 07 AM ) Alondra : I can go ahead and send a request over to our Delivery Specialist to reach out to the carrier to have your package re-routed to your default delivery address which is 3806 E El Carmen Ave .

( 01 : 21 : 15 AM ) Cesar Cortez : Regardless , if I am unable to retrieve the package , what would be the next step ?

( 01 : 22 : 24 AM ) Alondra : I do apologize , as when you made the default delivery address change in your subscription settings , the message box will advise you that you will also need to go into your meal planner and update the delivery address of each of your upcoming weekly deliveries in your meal planner , so that it can take affect right away to those orders that were shown in your meal planner .

( 01 : 22 : 39 AM ) Alondra : However , I sincerely apologize that any of this was missed !

( 01 : 23 : 02 AM ) Cesar Cortez : I do appreciate your assistance . I thought I did make every step to update it .

( 01 : 23 : 48 AM ) Cesar Cortez : Ok , will I be able to refer to this conversation somehow if need be , if an issue were to occur ?

( 01 : 24 : 57 AM ) Alondra : Yes , as we do keep all and every contact from our customers as records . Once the chat is over , you are given the option to email this chat transcript to yourself for your records . Would you like for me to go ahead and send the request to our Delivery Specialist to try reaching out to the carrier to have your package re-routed to your 3806 E El Carmen Ave delivery address ?

Thank you for reaching out to me via chat !

I wanted to go ahead and follow up with you in regards to your Sunday , December 30th order as our chat had gotten disconnected .

( 01 : 38 : 23 AM ) Taylor L. : These are priced at $ 49.99 , $ 59.99 , $ 89.99 , and $ 107.99 , respectively . Your plan of choice will arrive in a single shipment each week .

( 01 : 38 : 28 AM ) Taylor L. : We are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week !

( 01 : 38 : 41 AM ) Greg Behymer : I find a range , not an actual price .

( 01 : 39 : 24 AM ) Taylor L. : Our 4 meal plan is priced at $ 49.99 per week , our 6 meal plan $ 59.99 / week , 9 meal plan $ 89.99 / week , and our 12 meal plan $ 107.99 / week .

( 01 : 40 : 36 AM ) Greg Behymer : So I pick the meal any one ? So I would pick any 4 and be charged $ 49.99 per week ?

( 01 : 40 : 43 AM ) Taylor L. : Correct !

( 01 : 40 : 59 AM ) Taylor L. : You can view our current menu at :

https : / / www.freshly.com / on-the-menu

( 01 : 41 : 06 AM ) Taylor L. : We want to ensure the best variety in tastiness for our customers , so we add one new meal ( sometimes two ! ) to our menu almost every week . This would either involve adding in a completely new meal or revamping a pre-existing meal to make it even more delicious .

( 01 : 41 : 10 AM ) Greg Behymer : Ok . Thanks !

( 01 : 41 : 15 AM ) Taylor L. : My pleasure , Greg !

( 01 : 41 : 24 AM ) Taylor L. : Were there any other questions I could help answer today ?

( 01 : 40 : 28 AM ) Jay : I &apos;m sorry to hear that ! I &apos;d be happy to look into that for you .

( 01 : 40 : 34 AM ) Jay : One moment while I pull up your subscription .

( 01 : 42 : 37 AM ) Jay : Looks like there was a delay and your meals will not arrive on time . I do apologize this has occurred on your first delivery ! I &apos;ve forwarded this information to our Quality Assurance Team for further investigation and review .

Since the meals likely won &apos;t be arriving , I &apos;ve gone ahead and issued a refund of $ 39.99 to the CC that was charged . Please allow 3-5 days for this to post back to you . I &apos;ve also applied a $ 20 in-house credit to your subscription for the trouble . This will be automatically deducted from your next weekly order .

( 01 : 43 : 33 AM ) Scott Wahlberg : Crap .... but thank you

( 01 : 43 : 59 AM ) Jay : My pleasure ! My apologies once again Scott .

( 01 : 44 : 22 AM ) Jay : Is there anything else I can assist you with for now ? Hi !

I received my monthly subscription today but I only got 3 out of my 4 meals ? I &apos;d like to be reimbursed or credited for an extra meal or two -- as this mistaken wasn &apos;t on my end -

Thank you : - ) Hello Deniz ,

Thank you so much for reaching out this evening ,

I am so very sorry to hear you did not receive all of your meals this week . Rest assured , I have forwarded the incident to our QA and delivery team to review and contact you if need be .

Our Delivery Specialist will have FedEx destroy this package , however , if the meals do arrive I would advise of disposing of them immediately as they are no longer safe to consume .

( 01 : 49 : 27 AM ) Taylor L. : While delivery issues are certainly out of the norm , on occasion driver confusion , or address misunderstandings can wreak havoc . I &apos;m so sorry to see that you &apos;ve been the victim of such a circumstance !

( 01 : 49 : 10 AM ) Stephen : I am very sorry about that .

( 01 : 51 : 03 AM ) Stephen : I am showing the first 3 orders , November 29th , December 6th , and December 13th have all been fully refunded .

( 01 : 51 : 30 AM ) Stephen : The order for December 20th was discounted by $ 20.00 , to make the total $ 39.99 .

( 01 : 53 : 03 AM ) Brian Youngblood : Hmm . Maybe I ’ m confused . I see one refund for December 15 for 29.99 .

( 01 : 53 : 38 AM ) Stephen : So the first refund was initiated on November 30th , it would take 3-5 business days from that date to be returned .

( 01 : 54 : 25 AM ) Stephen : The 2nd refund for December 6th had also been refunded on the 30th .

( 01 : 54 : 39 AM ) Brian Youngblood : On December 14th the charge was 39.99

( 01 : 55 : 09 AM ) Stephen : Yes , that was discounted by $ 20.00 from a in-store credit that was applied for the delayed orders .

( 01 : 55 : 16 AM ) Stephen : The full charge for the 6 meal plan is $ 59.99 .

( 01 : 55 : 47 AM ) Brian Youngblood : rhen on the 15 a refund for 29.99 . So wouldn ’ t I get a refund of 39.99 ?

( 01 : 57 : 07 AM ) Stephen : There are 3 refunds in total . $ 39.00 initiated on November 30th , $ 39.99 also initiated on November 30th , and finally $ 29.99 , that was initiated December 14th .

( 01 : 57 : 49 AM ) Brian Youngblood : so the last should be 39.99 not 29.99

( 01 : 58 : 26 AM ) Stephen : The in-store credit that was on the subscription is for $ 20.00 making the final price for December 20th $ 39.99 .

( 02 : 00 : 41 AM ) Brian Youngblood : its my understanding I should not have been charged for any boxes because they arrived late except Dow the last box .

( 02 : 01 : 04 AM ) Stephen : Were you emailed that information ?

We &apos;re so sorry your delivery was delayed . A note about your delivery

Dear Valerie ,

We &apos;ve been advised by our delivery partner that your order didn ’ t arrive yesterday as scheduled . This is definitely not the type of experience we want for our customers .

The good news is that your meals should arrive today and are still fresh . ( Our packaging is designed to withstand two days in transit , plus 12 hours on your doorstep , and today is the second day of transit . )

Please accept our apologies — it &apos;s extremely frustrating to expect to get your meals and then have to make a new plan . As a thanks for your patience and understanding , we ’ ve added a $ 10 in-store credit to your subscription ; this will be valid for six months from now and will automatically apply the next time you &apos;re charged for an order .

Again , we &apos;re so sorry about this ! If you have any questions at all , you can reach our Delivery Team using the contact icons below .

While we &apos;ll certainly be sorry to see you go , I &apos;ve cancelled your subscription here , so you won &apos;t have any further charges , and the delivery here would be the last one .

You won &apos;t need to do anything further there , though you can always resubscribe if you wish through the Subscription Settings , or just by letting us know .

Thank you for giving us a try , Valerie , and please let me know if there &apos;s anything more I can check up on here to lend a hand . I &apos;ll be glad to help however I can !

Customer Care SpecialistI have no problem with your meals . They &apos;re fine , if rather repetitive . My issue is with OnTrac . As you can see , they &apos;re totally unreliable . Is there any way you can use literally anyone else to deliver to me ? I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s FedEx or UPS or pony express . Anyone is better than OnTrac . FedEx and UPS deliver to me all the time . If so , I &apos;d happily come back but I can &apos;t continue to not know if my meals will be delivered , if they &apos;ll be left in the rain or left in a ditch or just disappear . ( they &apos;ve actually done things like that ) .

Please let me know .


--Hello Valerie ,

Thank you for reaching out to us today ! I &apos;m very sorry for the multiple inconvenience &apos;s the carrier has placed you in ! Upon review of your zip code OnTrac does handle the majority of deliveries but I did see that FedEx is used for Saturday deliveries , would this work ?

Come the new year I &apos;m pretty sure OnTrac will still remain as one of our main carriers to used but this can very well change , just to be completely honest with you we have gotten plenty feedback regarding them .

If you have any questions please don &apos;t hesitate on reaching out to me , I &apos;d be happy to assist ! Have a wonderful weekend !

Sent from my iPadHello Sandy ,

Thank you for reaching out . I am so sorry to hear that you have been having delivery issues .

Please know my Delivery Specialist is working to make this right ! I am so sorry you haven &apos;t received your meals for the last two weeks . I &apos;m afraid it looks as though they are going to reattempt delivery on the next business day . However , your meals will be considered spoiled by then . I am going to attempt to get this package destroyed but if they do arrive , please dispose of the meals . We don &apos;t want you to get sick by eating them !

I have issued a refund in the amount of $ 29.99 . Please allow 3-5 business days for that credit to appear on your account depending on your bank . To further express my apologies , I &apos;ve provided a 50 % in-house credit in the amount of $ 30 that will automatically apply to your next scheduled delivery .

Again , Sandy , I am terribly sorry for the experience you &apos;ve had with your deliveries . Please let me know if I can further assist you with anything else , I &apos;d be happy to help .

Thanks for reaching out ! I &apos;m AJ , and I &apos;m happy to assist you .

A little about Freshly , we were started in Tucson , Arizona and now our headquarters is in New York City . Currently , all of our meals are prepared at our facility in Phoenix , Arizona and we &apos;re excited to announce that we &apos;re opening up another facility in Savage , Maryland in early 2019 !

We are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Signing up for Freshly must be done online as we &apos;re unable to accept payment methods over the phone . However , once your account is set up we &apos;re more than happy to assist you with everything else on the phone !

Our office hours are Monday through Sunday , from 6 AM to 11 PM PST . You can call or text us at 1-844-373-7459 ( 1-844-FRESHLY ) . I hope this helps ! Please let me know if you have any questions or give us a call , I &apos;m so excited that you &apos;re considering Freshly !

I &apos;m so sorry for any confusion in regards to your upcoming order , Shawn ! I &apos;m absolutely happy to take care of this for you , as we certainly don &apos;t mean to catch anyone by surprise !

I hope this helps , Shawn , and if you should need anything further , please reach out , as I &apos;m always happy to help !

I &apos;m afraid Ontrac is currently the only carrier able to deliver in your area at this time . We always take delivery issues very seriously and certainly work with all of our carriers to get our meals to customers &apos; doors . Please don &apos;t hesitate to reach out if you experience any issues with your Freshly deliveries !

It looks like your delivery scheduled for today is currently out for delivery . With the holiday season , our carriers have extended their business hours so deliveries may be later than usual . If you don &apos;t receive this package tonight , please reach out to us at your earliest convenience tomorrow and we will do everything we can to make the situation right .

Just as a friendly FYI , ( or reminder if you already knew ! ) we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Friday , your weekly deadline to make changes is Saturday before 2 : 00 pm PT . I see your next scheduled delivery is Thursday , January 10th however . In this case , your deadline would be Friday by 2pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


These are just a few of the really helpful links in our FAQ . You can always access even more information from our FAQ page by clicking on the &quot; Help &quot; tab in the upper right hand corner while logged into your account ! And of course , we are always happy to assist via email , text or phone at 844-FRESHLY or via chat ! Our current hours of operation are from 6am-11pm PT every day .

I hope this helps , Terry , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

115 E. 23rd St. , 7th Floor , New York , NY 10010Hello Kevin ,

Thank you for your contacting us today . I &apos;m so very sorry for this inconvenience !

I &apos;m so very sorry for the inconvenience and the frustrations involved , as I know many customers depend on their Freshly meals and we always aim to ensure the timeliness of our deliveries ! I will be sure to report this to our carrier in an effort to improve our service .

For the delay , I have issued a full $ 59.99 a refund that will post back to the card on file within 3-5 business days . I have also applied a further in-store credit in the amount of $ 20 to your subscription . The credit will remain active on your subscription for 6 months from today and will apply automatically to your next charge on that subscription .

I will be sure to request that the carrier destroy this package , however , if the meals do arrive past tomorrow night . I would advise disposing of them immediately , as we can no longer guarantee that they would be safe to consume .

Again , I apologize greatly for this inconvenience Kevin ! If there ’ s anything I can do to help , please don ’ t hesitate to let me know !

Customer Service LeadHi ,

I ’ m seriously considering your meal programs and was wondering if you do , or could , provide Weight Watchers point values for your meals ? If not , is this something that could be calculated . I would love to integrate this with my lifestyle . Thank you ! Hello Lindsay ,

Thank you so much for reaching out to us , and for your interest in Freshly !

We don &apos;t currently have meal points in place for Weight Watchers at this time and I don &apos;t believe we have those points calculated as of now , either .

While we don ’ t design our meals as part of a weight loss program , we do have customers who lose weight while eating Freshly . We build our meals around real , whole foods like nutrient-dense carbs , high-quality proteins , and healthy fats , and eliminate many of the processed and artificial ingredients that can contribute to weight gain or stall weight loss .

We believe that when you focus on the quality of the foods you ’ re eating , the calories don ’ t matter as much . But if you ’ re looking for more information around the calories in our meals , we offer a sort option on the “ Choose Meals ” page where you can sort by calories from lowest to highest .

There are other factors at play when it comes to diet and weight loss goals , so we recommend that you check with your doctor or nutritionist to learn more about what might be best for you !

We are a weekly subscription service and we deliver our meals once per week . This means that you would be automatically sent ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis , and they would be delivered on your chosen available delivery day .

The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and skip weeks until you &apos;re ready to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline , which we provide for you via email when you sign up !

I &apos;ve included a few helpful links below to help you manage a subscription if you decide you &apos;d like to give us a try :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


I hope this helps , Lindsay , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! Since you use Ontrac for shipping , I did not receive my first order . I run a retail business , and the delivery never arrived . I was at my store until 7PM . It is regrettable that you utilize Ontrac in my area . Their service is very unreliable . I will try my residential address , hopefully they will leave it at my door . I am really looking forward to your service , but I am concerned about Ontrac.Dear Freshly Support


Please cancel my account effective immediately . I hesitate to do this , but both my wife and I agree that we want to pursue other venues at this time .




Thank you


Jerry C BridgesHello Jerry ,

Thank you for reaching out !

While we &apos;re certainly sorry to see you go , I &apos;d like to confirm that your subscription has been successfully canceled . You will no longer receive any further deliveries or charges , a separate email will be sent to confirm the cancellation for your records .

I hope you &apos;ve enjoyed your time with Freshly and will consider joining us again in the near future . We have lots of new and exciting changes and many more delicious meals on the horizon ! With that said , if you do decide you &apos;d like to rejoin the Freshly family , we &apos;ve made it super easy to reactivate your subscription , by adding a &quot; Reactivate &quot; button that you can access from your subscription anytime after canceling ! I &apos;ve included a link below to show you just how it &apos;s done :

How do I reactivate my subscription ?

Again , Jerry , thank you for giving Freshly a try ! If there is anything else I can do to help , please let me know . I would be happy to assist !

Customer Care SpecialistAnd yet again , the delivery did not arrive . Fedex just sent a note saying it will be delivered on dec 15 at the end of the day . It ’ s been three consecutive weeks of attempted orders and not a single one has arrived . Right now FedEx is saying the delivery will
come in at the end of the day on the 15th .
Please tell me how to handle this . I live in the heart of Atlanta and don ’ t understand why I can ’ t get a package from Freshly on time .

We &apos;re so sorry your delivery was delayed .




A note about your delivery












Dear Chelsea ,



We &apos;ve been advised by our delivery partner that your order didn ’ t arrive yesterday as scheduled . This is definitely not the type of experience we want for our customers .




Because of this delay , your meals will have been unrefrigerated for an amount of time that makes them unsafe to eat . As a result , we have asked the carrier to discard your package , although there &apos;s a chance it will still arrive . If this happens ,
please dispose of the meals without eating them . Your health is our top priority and we can no longer guarantee the freshness of your order , even if the meals still feel cold .




Please accept our sincere apologies — it &apos;s extremely frustrating to expect to get your meals and then have to make a new plan . Due to this , we &apos;ve given you a
100 % refund for your order ( this should appear in your bank account within five business days ) . Additionally , we &apos;ve added a
50 % in-store credit to your subscription for a box of the same number of meals . This in-store credit will be valid for six months from now and will automatically apply the next time you &apos;re charged for an order .




Again , we &apos;re so sorry about this and truly appreciate your patience !



Sincerely ,

The Freshly Team

115 E. 23rd St. , 7th Floor , New York , NY 10010Hi Chelsea ,

Thanks for reaching out to us .

I am so very sorry for the continued troubles with delivery ! Communication is very important to us and we do our very best to keep you updated whenever there is a possible issue . While carrier delays are certainly out of the norm , weather-related issues , road closures , driver confusion , etc. can wreak havoc . A lot can happen between our kitchen in Phoenix and your home in Atlanta . I &apos;m terribly sorry that you &apos;ve been the victim of such a circumstance once again .

Of course , we do everything we can to avoid these situations , though we &apos;re always sure to compensate when they arise . I know with the upcoming holidays , the carriers are experiencing a large influx of packages over the next month which can cause a bit of a backup . Rest assured , we are actively working with our delivery partners to rectify any potential issues .

We &apos;ll be sure to follow up with the carrier in regards to this week &apos;s order . I completely understand the inconvenience and frustrations involved . I know many customers depend on their Freshly meals , and we always aim to ensure the timeliness of our deliveries .

Once again , I &apos;m truly sorry for the issue with delivery though I do hope this helps ! Please let me know if you should have absolutely any questions or concerns , Chelsea . I &apos;m here to help with whatever you need !

( 03 : 20 : 25 AM ) Breana : I am so sorry for any confusion . You can certainly skip any weeks needed , Mark !

( 03 : 20 : 49 AM ) Breana : However , it is important to keep in mind that our production process takes at least 5 days , where we take the time to procure the best ingredients possible , prep and cook the meals , and then shipping .

( 03 : 24 : 40 AM ) Marilyn Pollock : so I would like to have six meals for December 20 and then when would your next deliveries be any day of the week ?

( 03 : 25 : 19 AM ) Taylor L. : It looks like the next scheduled delivery after the holidays would be Thursday , January 10th . Unfortunately as that date is so far out it looks like we &apos;re unable to make any changes to that order at this time .

( 03 : 25 : 57 AM ) Marilyn Pollock : OK then just do the December 20 thank you

( 03 : 26 : 59 AM ) Taylor L. : My pleasure ! I &apos;ve added our vegetarian Butternut Squash Risotto and Moroccan-Style Root Veggie Tagine to that December 20th order ! ( Our Veggie Baked Penne is actually vegetarian as well ! )

( 03 : 27 : 07 AM ) Taylor L. : Is there anything else I can assist you with tonight , Marilyn ?

( 03 : 27 : 44 AM ) Marilyn Pollock : Yes Could I also ordered the same as six meals for December 21 ?

( 03 : 28 : 30 AM ) Taylor L. : It looks like after the 20th the soonest we could get meals to you would actually be December 24th !

( 03 : 28 : 49 AM ) Marilyn Pollock : OK that would be great

( 03 : 29 : 04 AM ) Taylor L. : Give me one moment to set that up !

( 03 : 31 : 52 AM ) Taylor L. : So I have you all set for that December 24th delivery with 1 Butternut Squash Risotto , 1 Grilled Chicken Risotto , 1 Moroccan-Style Root Veggie Tagine , 1 Veggie Baked Penne , 1 Shepherd &apos;s Pie , and 1 Steak Peppercorn .

( 03 : 32 : 14 AM ) Taylor L. : You can make changes to those meals until Wednesday , December 19th at 2PM PST .

( 03 : 32 : 39 AM ) Marilyn Pollock : OK so now I will get six meals on the 20th and the same six meals on the 24th is that correct because that ’ s what I want

( 03 : 32 : 45 AM ) Taylor L. : Correct !

( 03 : 32 : 57 AM ) Marilyn Pollock : Thanks for all your help I really appreciate it bye

( 03 : 00 : 13 AM ) Alondra : Hello Marla !

( 03 : 00 : 17 AM ) Alondra : Thank you for reaching out to us !

( 03 : 00 : 25 AM ) Marla Savano : Hi

( 03 : 00 : 46 AM ) Alondra : I certainly understand and will be more than happy to look into this for you , Marla !

( 03 : 00 : 50 AM ) Alondra : One moment while I pull up your subscription to look into this for you !

( 03 : 06 : 37 AM ) Alondra : I do apologize , as per the tracking information from OnTrac , it states that when they attempted to deliver today &quot; Linehaul delayed by a road closure . &quot; and due to this , they were not able to deliver the package today . Since we only package our meals to withstand 2 full days of transit time and up to 12 hours upon delivery , the meals will no longer be safe to be consumed if re-delivered on the next business day , as OnTrac does not deliver on the weekends .

( 03 : 07 : 08 AM ) Alondra : In light of this , I &apos;ve let our Delivery Specialist know to reach out to the carrier to have the package destroyed and to also investigate this matter further with the carrier .

( 03 : 07 : 42 AM ) Marla Savano : well that &apos;s a shame .

( 03 : 08 : 01 AM ) Marla Savano : I &apos;m glad I contacted you

( 03 : 08 : 03 AM ) Alondra : To further express my apologies , I ’ ve gone ahead and issued a full refund in the amount of $ 49.99 back to your card on file for your Friday , December 14th order . Please do allow up to 3-5 business days for the funds to post onto your bank account ( depending on your banking institution ) .

( 03 : 08 : 17 AM ) Alondra : I ’ ve also gone ahead and applied an in-house credit in the amount of $ 20 onto your subscription for the inconvenience . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically be applied towards your next charged order .

( 03 : 08 : 36 AM ) Alondra : I do sincerely apologize once again , Marla !

( 03 : 09 : 23 AM ) Marla Savano : Not your fault at all . So sorry to see it costing you but I really appreciate the care you have given me .

( 03 : 09 : 57 AM ) Alondra : You &apos;re so welcome and I will certainly pass along your feedback over to our team .

( 03 : 10 : 03 AM ) Alondra : Is there anything else I can assist you with this evening , Marla ?

( 03 : 11 : 01 AM ) Marla Savano : I just feel I have to say I am going away and will not be ordering for 3 weeks after this . Don &apos;t want it to reflect this problem . By the way where is my food prepared ?

( 03 : 12 : 25 AM ) Alondra : I certainly understand your concerns and the reason as to why they were not able to deliver the package to you today , was due to a road closure in your area that prohibited the OnTrac driver to be able to deliver the package to you .

( 03 : 12 : 49 AM ) Alondra : Your meals are prepared , cooked , packaged and shipped from our kitchen here in Phoenix , Az .

( 03 : 13 : 34 AM ) Marla Savano : I would have bet you San Francisco . I love them and they are so fresh . I hope you have a Merry Christmas and of course a Happy New Year .

( 03 : 13 : 48 AM ) Alondra : Were you wanting to skip your next 3 weeks ?

( 03 : 14 : 35 AM ) Marla Savano : Yes I leave on the 23rd and return on Jan 7th . I think that covers 3 weeks .

( 03 : 14 : 39 AM ) Alondra : That is great to hear that you are enjoying your meals so far , Marla and I hope you have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year as well !

( 03 : 14 : 49 AM ) Alondra : Okay , one moment while I go ahead and skip those weeks for you .

( 03 : 16 : 14 AM ) Alondra : I &apos;ve gone ahead and skipped your Friday , December 21st , Friday , December 28th and Friday , January 4th orders for you . Your next scheduled delivery is set for Friday , January 11th and your weekly deadline to make any changes to this order is Sunday , January 6th before 2PM PT .

( 03 : 16 : 56 AM ) Marla Savano : Can the same thing I ordered this week be the same for Jan 11th ?

( 03 : 18 : 13 AM ) Alondra : I do apologize , as Friday , January 11th is not shown in your meal planner at this time , as we only forecast up to 3-4 weeks in advance . However , once Friday , January 11th is shown in your meal planner , you are able to go ahead and make those meal changes needed by your weekly deadline .

( 03 : 19 : 19 AM ) Marla Savano : so it should be there before the 23rd ? and if I forget to do it , lol , what would I get ?

( 03 : 20 : 18 AM ) Alondra : A new week will populate into your meal planner after each week . We will go ahead and send you your weekly email reminder to make any meal changes needed for an upcoming order by your weekly deadline .

( 03 : 20 : 56 AM ) Marla Savano : great they the reminder should give me a clue . Thanks for all your help .

( 03 : 19 : 02 AM ) Arlien Johnson : Well , I guess I won &apos;t have any dinner that week or the next . I will have to look at your competitors . I &apos;ve been a very good costomer

( 03 : 19 : 45 AM ) Breana : My sincere apologies , Arlien . As a growing company with only one facility ( located in Phoenix , Arizona ) , this can mean limited kitchen availability for the initial order . Kitchen availability is also being affected by the upcoming holidays and all the new orders being placed .

( 03 : 21 : 26 AM ) Breana : In addition , as we work on an automated system , we don ’ t have the ability to manually place an order or schedule different than what our system allows . For that , I ’ m very sorry ! Rest assured , your feedback has been forwarded along to the proper channels . We ’ re always diligently working to improve our meals and service , so every bit of information we receive in any regard - no matter how large or small ; good or bad - is highly appreciated !

( 03 : 21 : 31 AM ) Arlien Johnson : I &apos;ve ordered every week with you for quite awhile . Why wouldn &apos;t you give your regular customers first chice ! ?

( 03 : 23 : 34 AM ) Breana : My sincere apologies Arlien . You have to keep in mind that the days we are open for delivery are other customers default delivery days . That means that we may have been at capacity with just these orders .

( 03 : 23 : 56 AM ) Breana : We do close our kitchen for a few days these weeks to allow our employees time to spend with their families .

I don ’ t expect to get a discount or refund on any time that I have chatted with you . My intention is to let you know what is happening so that you are better aware . My husband and I are retired and disabled people &amp; amp ; we have a ramp that goes up to our house . On one of my recent complaints , the delivery person left the box of food from you on our ramp . That problem was resolved for a couple weeks , but the problem has returned . This time I took several pictures of our set up , and the box the way it was left on our ramp AGAIN in a terrible rainstorm . We had been gone for a while for a doctor appointment , &amp; amp ; when returning home we saw the box partially up our ramp and only halfway on the ramp . The box was totally soaked , and it made it very difficult for us to carry up the ramp into the house . The contents were fine . It was the delivery that was dismissed in the special notes that is the problem . Somehow your delivery people need to take your company more seriously . My husband and I really enjoy the meals we receive from you , but are getting frustrated with the quality of service in the delivery . Any ideas ? ?

( 03 : 33 : 12 AM ) AJ : I &apos;m sorry about the wait , hope it wasn &apos;t too long !

( 03 : 33 : 21 AM ) AJ : Yes , all of our meals are designed to be dinners .

( 03 : 33 : 32 AM ) AJ : Our meals are single servings intended for one person .

( 03 : 34 : 21 AM ) Michelle : Okay - are they all shipped on the same day or shipped seperately each day ?

( 03 : 34 : 34 AM ) AJ : Your plan of choice will arrive in a single shipment each week .

( 03 : 34 : 36 AM ) Michelle : No worries on the wait - it was short : )

( 03 : 34 : 55 AM ) AJ : We use third-party carriers like FedEx and Ontrac , shipping is always free for you .

( 03 : 36 : 45 AM ) Michelle : Hmmm ... so if , for example , I receive a meal with chicken in it on Monday , it will only be good for a few days . Do I have to frerze it if my pkan is to eat one of the six meals each day throughout the week ?

( 03 : 37 : 28 AM ) Michelle : Oops - freeze it - not frerze !

( 03 : 37 : 38 AM ) AJ : The meals that we send to customers have a use-by date of about 4 days after they are delivered - although the shelf life could vary slightly in some cases . You can check the “ use by ” date on a meal ’ s cardboard sleeve for more specifics regarding that meal itself . We do the best we can to ensure the freshness of our meals by packaging them securely and ensuring they are nice and cool during the shipping process .

( 03 : 37 : 43 AM ) AJ : Please bear in mind that our meals are literally fresh - meaning that we cook them and then ship them right to you - so , as would be the case when you cook food for yourself , the freshness factor inherently puts restrictions on the shelf life . We also don &apos;t add artificial or chemical preservatives to our meals , because we strive to be all-natural in all aspects of our food preparation .

( 03 : 37 : 51 AM ) AJ : Our meals are designed to be refrigerated to preserve their freshness , but we understand that life happens and you are not always able to eat them right away . Therefore , if freezing is necessary , you can indeed freeze the meals . If you do go the freezing route , please follow these heating instructions : 1 . Do not defrost . 2 . Microwave for 1 min from frozen state . 3 . Follow original heating instructions provided .

( 03 : 38 : 58 AM ) AJ : I live alone and I &apos;m on our 12-meal plan . I typically put 3 or 4 meals into the freezer when I get them !

( 03 : 40 : 03 AM ) Michelle : Perfect ! ! Our daughter is leaving for college &amp; amp ; doesn ’ t want to live off dorm food ! ! So we were trying to find an alternative . Sounds like this may very well be the answer . Thanks for all your help ! ! Appreciate it : )

( 03 : 40 : 57 AM ) AJ : Great idea for your daughters meals !

( 03 : 41 : 04 AM ) AJ : My favorite is the Sausage Penne by the way !

( 03 : 41 : 23 AM ) Michelle : Will pass that on to her . Thanks !

( 03 : 41 : 24 AM ) AJ : I always like to remind our new customers that we &apos;re a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week !

Customer Care SpecialistWe have only had few , but the time needed to cook is about a minute too short and flavor has just been ok - kind of dry.Hey Carlene ,

Thank you for reaching back out !

I do know each microwave has it &apos;s own power settings so i would try to see what might work best to completely heat up the meals . If you feel a meal needs that extra kick , feel free to add some more spices or sauce ! We try to make each meal as great as possible on it &apos;s own but for some ( like myself ) a little extra goes a long way .

If you feel you don &apos;t like the food overall , you can cancel at anytime with no penalties or fees . If you have any other questions , feel free to reach back out to us !



Fresh wishes ,
Eric C.

Customer Care SpecialistI would like to cancel , but I guess I have a credit from an order that was to ship that I didn ’ t realize was going to happen , so they did a credit . ? Hey Carlene ,

Thank you for your response , Eric is out of the office , but I am here to help !

With that said , I can confirm that your subscription is canceled you will no longer receive any further charges or deliveries unless you chose to reactivate .

As for the in-house credit , I went ahead and revoked it , and provided a full refund in the amount of $ 75 . That refund will process in 3-5 business days .

I hope this helped , Carlene , and if you have any additional questions or concerns , please reach back out to me !

Your next upcoming order is set for Saturday , January 5th and you do have until Sunday , December 30th before 2 PM PT to make any changes .

I hope this helps , Ivo ! If you have any questions or concerns , please feel free to reach back out to me !

603-620-2912Hi Darlene ,

Thank you for reaching out to us here at Freshly !

I am happy to assist you with any questions ! Your meals will come to you fully cooked so you just have to heat ‘ em up in the microwave . On the back of each meal , you ’ ll find our easy steps for heating , but generally , the meals heat up in about three minutes ( depending on your microwave ) . If you ’ re unsure , start at 2 minutes and heat in 30-second increments until the temperature is right for you .

If you ’ d rather heat your meals in the oven , read how to do that here .

We ’ re a weekly subscription meal service that delivers fresh ( not frozen ) prepared meals , developed by our team of chefs and nutritionists . They ’ re fully cooked so all you have to do is heat ‘ em up — each meal is ready to eat in only 3 minutes . So no more worrying about what ’ s for dinner ( or lunch ! ) . No shopping , no chopping , no cleanup . But also no artificial ingredients , preservatives or added sugars .

We started Freshly because we believe eating fresh , nutritious dishes every day should be easy for everyone . So we do all the hard work for you — sourcing high-quality ingredients , making sure each meal you eat is nutrient dense and packed with the good stuff , and expertly cooking your food to order so it tastes fresh and delicious .

If there is anything else I can assist you with , Darlene , do let me know !

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! HI Adam , thanks for the quick reply ! How long are the meals good for ? Im requesting a friday delivery to use saturday , sunday , monday ,






--Hello Darlene !

Happy to help , so do ask me any questions you may have !

Since we don ’ t use artificial or chemical preservatives , the meals have a refrigerated shelf life of about 4 – 5 days . Every meal has a “ use by ” date on the back nutrition label .

Even though our meals taste best when eaten fresh , you can freeze them if you can ’ t get to them by their “ use by ” date . You simply need to add a couple of minutes to the heating time and reheat from frozen , without thawing . We recommend confirming that the food is reheated to 165 degrees , the same as reheating from fresh !

I hope this helps , Darlene , and I hope we can cook for you soon !

Don &apos;t forget to check out our iPhone app ! thanks ! One more question , I just went into my acct to change my delivery date to a sunday . Its still showing up as friday jan 25th . What will the date be for my first delivery if its on a sunday ?

Also , can you only choose meals one week at a time or can I set up the month ?


ty !


--Hello again ,

So sorry for any confusion , your initial order will be delivered on the 25th , but after that , it will be on Sundays . You can typically plan your meals out three weeks in advance , so as we get closer to January 25th , you will see those future weeks become available !

Just as a friendly FYI , ( or reminder if you already knew ! ) we are a subscription service . This means that you will automatically be delivered ( and charged for ) meals on a weekly basis . The good news is , you don &apos;t have to commit to receiving weekly meals ! It &apos;s super easy to make changes to the meals you receive and to skip individual weeks , so you don &apos;t receive any charges or deliveries until you decide to rejoin us ! You just need to do so by your weekly deadline .

Based on your chosen delivery day of Sunday your weekly deadline to make changes is Monday before 2 : 00 pm PT .

Below , I &apos;ve included a few links to help you manage your subscription :


How do I make changes to a week vs. my whole subscription ?
How do I change my meals for an upcoming order ?
How do I skip a week ?


These are just a few of the really helpful links in our FAQ . You can always access even more information from our FAQ page by clicking on the &quot; Help &quot; tab in the upper right-hand corner while logged into your account ! And of course , we are always happy to assist via email , text or phone at 844-FRESHLY or via chat ! Our current hours of operation are from 6am-11pm PT every day .

I hope this helps , Darlene , and if you have any other questions or concerns , please don &apos;t hesitate to let me know !

Thank you for reaching out to us ! I do apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you !

Due to the holidays , we were unable to deliver to you for Friday , December 28th and since no alternative date was chosen , you were automatically skipped for this week and not charged . This was outlined throughout your meal planner , as on Saturday , December 1st shown that you were not scheduled for Friday , December 28th as we do forecast up to 3 weeks in advance and you are able to plan ahead . However , I sincerely apologize that any of this was missed !

Your next scheduled delivery is set for Friday , January 4th and your weekly deadline to make any changes to this order is Sunday , December 30th before 2PM PT .

Once again , my sincerest apologies Nancy ! If you should need further assistance , please reach out , as I am always happy to help !

Thank you for your response !

During holiday weeks , we do have a shortened production schedule as we close down our kitchen facility in order to give our extremely hard-working kitchen team some time off to spend with their families . Due to this , we are not able to offer as many delivery day options for specific weeks . On top of this , the third-party carriers we use also do not work on certain days during holiday weeks , rendering it impossible for us to get orders sent out for particular days . So due to the holiday for the week , our kitchen being closed and the carriers also not delivering for certain days of the holiday week , it is why we were unable to deliver to you for Friday , December 28th .

However , your feedback is not only appreciated but vitally important to our business as this is what helps us grow as a company . We &apos;re constantly striving to improve our service , so I &apos;ll be sure to pass this along to our marketing team in regards to emails being sent out to impacted customers when a major holiday is to come .

All in all , every bit of information we receive in any regard - no matter how large or small ; good or bad - is an opportunity for us to gain the knowledge of what our customers are looking for from us .

To further express my apologies , I have gone ahead and applied an in-house credit in the amount of $ 20 onto your subscription for the inconvenience of this , as I see that you are a loyal customer with us . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically be applied towards your next charged order .

My sincerest apologies once again , Nancy ! If you should need further assistance , please reach back out , as I &apos;d be more than happy to help !



Fresh wishes ,
Alondra R.

( 03 : 56 : 30 AM ) Jody : Do you have any meals that meet the paleo diet plan ?

( 03 : 56 : 33 AM ) * * * KB joined the chat * * *

( 03 : 56 : 37 AM ) KB : Hello !

( 03 : 56 : 44 AM ) KB : Good question , Jody !

( 03 : 56 : 49 AM ) KB : While our entire menu focuses on incorporating real , whole foods , we do have a segment of our menu that is paleo-friendly . These meals do not contain any grains , dairy , legumes , or soy . You &apos;ll find these meals indicated by a badge labeled as &quot; Paleo Friendly &quot; .

( 03 : 56 : 54 AM ) KB : We do offer several paleo-friendly meals , which is the foundation of the Whole30 diet . However , due to some of the limitations of Whole30 , our meals do not technically meet the guidelines of this program . This is because some of our meals contain paleo-friendly sweeteners , like honey , that are not recommended on the Whole30 plan . However , our paleo meals are the perfect option for those looking to follow a general paleo diet , or after transitioning out of a Whole30 program .

( 03 : 57 : 09 AM ) KB : Here is our menu ! : https : / / www.freshly.com / on-the-menu

( 03 : 58 : 21 AM ) Jody : Thank you .... are these meals specified as paleo or Whole30 meals ?

( 03 : 58 : 43 AM ) KB : Neither , really . Technically .

( 03 : 58 : 48 AM ) KB : We just make food !

( 03 : 59 : 00 AM ) KB : We don &apos;t adhere to any particular diet .

( 03 : 57 : 34 AM ) Alondra : Just as a friendly reminder , we are a subscription service , meaning that we will renew your subscription every week , charge your card , and send you meals , unless you skip weeks or cancel the subscription .

( 03 : 57 : 49 AM ) Alondra : Is there anything else I can assist you with this evening , Maryam ?

( 03 : 58 : 42 AM ) Maryam : ok so for 1 / 7 , will I receive 4 or 6 meals ?

( 03 : 59 : 16 AM ) Maryam : just wanted to make sure for that week it is still 6 . : )

( 03 : 59 : 18 AM ) Alondra : You will receive 6 meals as you signed up with the promo offer for 6 meals at $ 39.99 for your first week .

Thanks for your response .

( 03 : 55 : 46 AM ) Breana : Hello Christi

( 03 : 55 : 56 AM ) Breana : Thank you for contacting Freshly !

( 03 : 57 : 06 AM ) Breana : Our meals are prepped and cooked then shipped the same day . Depending on the delivery area , our customers will receive their meals in 1 to 2 days .

( 03 : 57 : 30 AM ) Breana : Our meals are designed to be heated in the microwave , since they already arrive fully cooked .

( 03 : 57 : 45 AM ) Breana : I can certainly check on the area if you can provide me with the zip code .

( 03 : 58 : 40 AM ) Christi Whitehouse : Thank you ! The zip code is 73717

( 03 : 58 : 52 AM ) Breana : No problem ! Just a moment while I check on that .

( 04 : 00 : 23 AM ) Breana : It looks like we deliver to that area from Tuesday to Saturday .

( 04 : 01 : 13 AM ) Christi Whitehouse : Great ! One more thing , how long are the meals good for in the fridge ?

( 04 : 01 : 29 AM ) Breana : All of our meals have a &quot; use by &quot; date . This date is typically set 4-5 days after delivery .

( 04 : 01 : 44 AM ) Breana : Our meals are designed to be refrigerated to preserve their freshness , but we understand that life happens and you are not always able to eat them right away . Therefore , if freezing is necessary , you can indeed freeze the meals .

( 04 : 02 : 38 AM ) Christi Whitehouse : Thanks , we are going to now !

( 04 : 02 : 52 AM ) Christi Whitehouse : Oops , order now .

( 03 : 12 : 47 AM ) Martin : Thank you for chatting in !

( 03 : 13 : 00 AM ) Martin : Definitely !

( 03 : 13 : 17 AM ) Martin : Typically , each meal has a refrigerated shelf-life of 3-5 days .

( 03 : 13 : 39 AM ) Martin : You can certainly freeze any meals before their use-by date , so that they can be good for an additional 2 weeks .

( 03 : 13 : 53 AM ) Martin : When ready to enjoy , you simply need to add a couple of minutes to the heating time and reheat from frozen , without thawing . We recommend confirming that the food is reheated to 165 degrees , the same as reheating from fresh !

( 03 : 14 : 56 AM ) ross cirrincione : Thanks . Received my first shipment today Will microwave under defrost or defrost before microwave cooking . Thi sis OK ?

( 03 : 15 : 21 AM ) Martin : That &apos;s great !

( 03 : 15 : 40 AM ) Martin : We would recommend heating without defrosting .

( 03 : 15 : 57 AM ) Martin : You would just have to add about 2 minutes to the heating time listed on the heating instructions .

( 03 : 18 : 06 AM ) Martin : Ross , is there anything else I may assist you with ?

( 03 : 18 : 25 AM ) ross cirrincione : No. thank you .

Since we only package our meals to withstand 2 full days of transit time and up to 12 hours upon delivery , the meals will no longer be safe to be consumed if re-delivered on the next business day . In light of this , I &apos;ve let our delivery specialist know to reach out to the carrier to have the package destroyed and to also investigate this matter further with FedEx in regards to what may have occurred with the package and why is was not delivered.Chat started : 2018-12-30 03 : 57 AM UTC

( 04 : 26 : 42 AM ) Taylor L. : What do you mean ?

( 04 : 26 : 55 AM ) abhiram danthala : My subscription starts on Jan 15

( 04 : 27 : 08 AM ) abhiram danthala : Can I get it started early may be Jan 1st

( 04 : 27 : 29 AM ) Taylor L. : Oh ! I see . Unfortunately at this time our kitchen is at capacity for orders so the soonest we can get meals to you will be January 15th .

( 04 : 27 : 48 AM ) abhiram danthala : Also you guys charged me long back

( 04 : 28 : 02 AM ) abhiram danthala : When do you usually charge my account ?

( 04 : 28 : 08 AM ) Taylor L. : We do charge when you first create your subscription with us so we can confirm your payment information and confirm your initial order .

( 04 : 28 : 18 AM ) Taylor L. : We are a weekly subscription service , meaning we will charge your card and send you deliveries of delicious meals every week unless you skip a week or cancel your subscription . We will notify you of the deadline via email and it &apos;s also listed on the Meal Planner , in the upper right corner when viewing a particular week .

( 04 : 28 : 25 AM ) Taylor L. : Your charge day will depend on your default delivery date .

( 04 : 28 : 31 AM ) Taylor L. : Could you please verify the phone number associated with the subscription so I can see when that would be ?

( 04 : 28 : 57 AM ) Taylor L. : Your deadline for making changes to your meals and your charge date is every Thursday before 2 pm PT , and will only change if you alter your delivery date .

( 04 : 29 : 17 AM ) abhiram danthala : Can I know the time of the delivery so that my food won ’ t get spoiled ?

( 04 : 29 : 47 AM ) Taylor L. : Your meals could be delivered between 8am and 9pm , but this time frame is not guaranteed and dependent on the driver , the driver ’ s route , and other factors .

( 04 : 30 : 10 AM ) abhiram danthala : I won ’ t be home from 8 to 5

( 04 : 30 : 16 AM ) Taylor L. : You are in a 1 day delivery zone and we package our meals for 2 days in transit and an additional 12 hours at your door , so a total of 60 hours after leaving out facility .

( 04 : 30 : 34 AM ) abhiram danthala : Oh okay .

( 04 : 30 : 38 AM ) Taylor L. : So even if you bring in your meals when you arrive home as long as they are still cool to the touch they will be perfectly safe !

( 04 : 32 : 00 AM ) abhiram danthala : Yes

( 04 : 32 : 21 AM ) Taylor L. : You could set up multiple subscriptions , 2 for our 12 meal plan and 1 for our 4 meal plan . This will give you 28 meals a week !

( 04 : 32 : 34 AM ) abhiram danthala : Within 1 account ?

( 04 : 24 : 02 AM ) Breana : I am so sorry for any troubles . The dates you are given at sign up are soonest available delivery days in your area .

( 04 : 24 : 41 AM ) Heather Wright : If I used a different address could I get them sooner ?

( 04 : 24 : 52 AM ) Heather Wright : Like maybe one I ’ m Austin ?

( 04 : 26 : 52 AM ) Breana : Thank you for that . Just a moment while I look into this for you .

( 04 : 28 : 53 AM ) Breana : My sincere apologies . It seems the soonest delivery for that area is also Saturday , January 12th . Our production process takes at least 5 days , where we take the time to procure the best ingredients possible , prep and cook the meals , and then shipping .

( 04 : 28 : 55 AM ) Breana : I ’ m truly sorry for the troubles ! As a growing company with only one facility ( located in Phoenix , Arizona ) , this can mean limited kitchen availability for the initial order . Kitchen availability is also being affected by the upcoming holidays and all the new orders being placed .

( 04 : 29 : 22 AM ) Heather Wright : Okay no worries

( 04 : 29 : 27 AM ) Heather Wright : One more question

( 04 : 29 : 48 AM ) Heather Wright : Once I receive the food , how long does it stay good in the fridge ?

( 04 : 29 : 58 AM ) Breana : No problem !

( 04 : 30 : 04 AM ) Breana : All of our meals have a &quot; use by &quot; date . This date is typically set 4-5 days after delivery .

( 04 : 30 : 08 AM ) Breana : Our meals are designed to be refrigerated to preserve their freshness , but we understand that life happens and you are not always able to eat them right away . Therefore , if freezing is necessary , you can indeed freeze the meals . If you do go the freezing route , please follow these heating instructions : 1 . Do not defrost . 2 . Microwave for 1 min from frozen state . 3 . Follow original heating instructions provided .

( 04 : 30 : 56 AM ) Heather Wright : Is the food shipped from Arizona ?

( 04 : 31 : 08 AM ) Heather Wright : How long is the shipping process ?

( 04 : 31 : 47 AM ) Breana : That is correct . Because you are in Texas , your meals will be delivered in 1 day .

( 04 : 32 : 04 AM ) Heather Wright : Okay thank you !

( 04 : 29 : 09 AM ) KB : I sincerely apologize about any inconvenience this caused , Jenny !

( 04 : 29 : 37 AM ) KB : According to our tracking notes , I do see that your delivery was delivered to your front door . I apologize once again about the confusion ! I have gone ahead and issued a 100 % in-store credit in the amount of $ 59.99 to cover the cost of the meals you were charged for . This is a one-time credit that expires 6 months from today and will automatically apply toward your next charged order . I &apos;ve also reported this incident to our Delivery Specialist . They will make sure that we do everything we can to prevent a repeat of this situation !

( 04 : 30 : 09 AM ) Jenny Vallejo : I would really just prefer a refund rather than an in-store credit , this is not the first time we &apos;ve had an issue with delivery .

( 04 : 30 : 22 AM ) KB : I see .

( 04 : 30 : 31 AM ) Jenny Vallejo : We live in an apartment and there are package lockers with a sign that clearly says no perishable boxes are to be left in there , and they have left the box in there the past three deliveries .

( 04 : 30 : 51 AM ) Jenny Vallejo : Thankfully we &apos;ve been able to go down and get them out in time , but that is clearly not where they are to be left , and the ice packs are usually almost melted by the time we are able to get to them .

Will you be keeping the subscription with us open ?

( 04 : 32 : 22 AM ) Jenny Vallejo : This has been the most inconvenient , we hadn &apos;t planned on grocery shopping since we had this coming , and now we have to since our package was never delivered

I was scheduled to receive my order today , Staurday December 29 , 2018 , but it wasn &apos;t delivered . I checked FedEx shipping and it looks like it was delayed by a few days ( they say Wednesday , 01 / 02 / 2019 ) . Is there any way I can get a refund for this week as the food will not have been refrigerated for a few days or have my food reshipped ?

Thank you ,


Alyssa Slaughter
2103263593Hey Alyssa ,

Thanks so much for reaching out tonight !

I &apos;m so sorry that you have not received your order today , as scheduled ! After looking over your delivery , there does appear to be a delay and I ’ m afraid your meals won &apos;t be arriving to you within a safe time-frame . Our Delivery Specialist will reach out to the carrier to destroy this package , however , if the meals do arrive I would advise of disposing of them immediately as they are no longer safe to consume--they will have been in transit a day longer than our box is guaranteed to keep them fresh .

While delivery issues are certainly out of the norm , on occasion driver confusion , or address misunderstandings can wreak havoc . I &apos;m so sorry to see that you &apos;ve been the victim of such a circumstance !

I &apos;ve gone ahead and applied a full $ 49.99 refund for this order , please allow 3-5 business days for the funds to post to your account , depending on your financial institution . Additionally , I &apos;ve issued you an in-house credit for $ 20 for the inconvenience of this situation . This one-time credit will automatically apply towards your next charged order , or remain on your subscription for 6 months from today &apos;s date .

As of right now , your next scheduled order is set for Saturday , January 5th . Your in-house credit will automatically apply towards this order , unless you choose to skip that order , which you have until Monday , December 31st to do . Please remember that your weekly deadline to make any changes to your weekly order is every Monday before 2 PM PT .

Again , Alyssa , please accept my sincerest apologies for this issue , and please feel free to reach out if there is anything further I can do to assist you !

Thanks ,

ChrisHello Chris ,

Thanks for reaching out to us today .

I &apos;m so very sorry to hear that you received an incorrect meal . There are a couple of reasons you may have received a meal you did not select for the week . On occasion , we may run out of the ingredients for a meal that you have selected , or there are instances where a meal has been discontinued and is replaced with another meal . Even more rarely , an incorrect meal may be packed into your box . Whatever the case , thank you for letting us know -- we will certainly credit your subscription for the cost and inconvenience !

I &apos;ve applied an in-store credit of $ 20 for the value of that meal as well as the inconvenience , this credit will automatically apply to your next order with us . I &apos;ll also be forwarding this issue to our Quality Assurance team to look into and try to ensure this doesn &apos;t happen again .

I hope this helps , Chris , and please don &apos;t hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns you may have .

( 04 : 17 : 23 AM ) Jay : Here is the message .

( 04 : 17 : 30 AM ) Jay : &quot; I do apologize , as according to the tracking information from FedEx , the last status update of the order was that it arrived at the FedEx hub at 1 : 29am today and since then there has not been no status update of the order . Since we only package our meals to withstand 2 full days of transit time and up to 12 hours upon delivery , the meals will no longer be safe to be consumed if re-delivered on the next business day . In light of this , I &apos;ve let our delivery specialist know to reach out to the carrier to have the package destroyed and to also investigate this matter further with FedEx in regards to what may have occurred with the package and why is was not delivered . &quot;

( 04 : 20 : 05 AM ) Kathleen Grisdale : what compensation is there ?

( 04 : 21 : 26 AM ) Jay : I am showing a refund of $ 59.99 was issued to the CC that was charged . Please allow 3-5 days for this to post back to you ! An in-house credit of $ 20 was also applied to your subscription . This will be automatically deducted from your next open delivery .

( 04 : 23 : 20 AM ) Jay : Both accommodations were already handled by the previous representative .

( 04 : 23 : 40 AM ) Kathleen Grisdale : ok thank you

( 04 : 23 : 47 AM ) Jay : My pleasure Kathleen .

( 04 : 24 : 44 AM ) Jay : Is there anything else I can assist you with for now ?

( 04 : 25 : 06 AM ) Kathleen Grisdale : This issue has happened twice in a very short time . Is this something that can be explained ?

( 04 : 25 : 42 AM ) Jay : I do see this information was forwarded to our Delivery Specialist . After further investigation into this for you he &apos;ll likely reach out to you via email about what can be done .

( 04 : 26 : 07 AM ) Kathleen Grisdale : I have an additional question

( 04 : 26 : 15 AM ) Jay : Certainly .

( 04 : 28 : 35 AM ) Kathleen Grisdale : i would like to set a new delivery to my mom at a address in Michigan . I would like to get the referral benifit for doing this but not sure how to do this as I will be ordering and paying myself and shipping to her . Not sure if that makes sense ?

( 04 : 29 : 40 AM ) Jay : It does . However , obtaining the referral would only be able to be done if she started her own subscription . It would not be possible to refer another subscription within your account.l

( 04 : 29 : 42 AM ) Jay : account . *

( 04 : 30 : 53 AM ) Kathleen Grisdale : ok

( 04 : 38 : 01 AM ) Stephen : Hi Marjorie .

( 04 : 38 : 11 AM ) Stephen : I am happy to see if we have a active subscription for you .

( 04 : 38 : 23 AM ) Stephen : Can you please verify the phone number we would have on file for you ?

( 04 : 38 : 48 AM ) Marjorie Haller : 9706329706 or 9706854676

( 04 : 39 : 05 AM ) Stephen : Thank you very much .

( 04 : 39 : 17 AM ) Stephen : I am showing you do have a active subscription .

( 04 : 39 : 44 AM ) Stephen : You do not have any obligations to keep the subscription , the only obligation would be if you are wanting a different menu sent each week that you would have to go in before your deadline to update the menu .

( 04 : 40 : 52 AM ) Stephen : Your subscription is currently set for the 12 meal plan .

( 04 : 41 : 06 AM ) Marjorie Haller : So my only obligation on ordering is meeting the deadline for any given week I want food ?

( 04 : 41 : 25 AM ) Marjorie Haller : Am I obligated to order those 12 meals each week ?

( 04 : 42 : 17 AM ) Stephen : No , you are able to change your meal plan ! Once an order is charged though , it does lock us out of making changes to the meal plan , so you would just want to be sure to make any changes before your deadline , which is every Saturday at 2 : 00 PM PST .

( 04 : 42 : 45 AM ) Marjorie Haller : Or do I have to pay for them regardless of if I place an order ?

( 04 : 43 : 43 AM ) Stephen : Since we are a weekly subscription service , we will automatically charge you every Saturday for upcoming orders , and ship the orders out to arrive every Friday . You are able to skip as many weeks as you want , that would stop us from charging for that order , and stop us from sending the order .

( 04 : 44 : 03 AM ) Stephen : Here is how to skip a week in your Meal Planner :

( 04 : 28 : 34 AM ) Alondra : I certainly understand and will be more than happy to look into this for you !

( 04 : 28 : 39 AM ) Alondra : One moment while I pull up your subscription to look into this for you !

( 04 : 30 : 39 AM ) Alondra : I do apologize , but the email address that you provided on this chat which is jt4000 @ gmail.com has pulled up an account that has has two subscriptions that have been cancelled for over a year or two now . Is there another email address that you used for your active subscription ?

( 04 : 31 : 28 AM ) Jacki Trinh : give247 @ gmail.com

( 04 : 31 : 35 AM ) Alondra : Okay , thank you !

( 04 : 33 : 31 AM ) Alondra : I was able to pull up your active subscription with that email address , so thank you ! However , I do apologize , as your Sunday , December 30th order has already shipped out and since it is in the hands of the carrier , I am not able to cancel your Sunday , December 30th order for tomorrow , as your weekly deadline to do so was Monday , December 24th before 2PM PT .

( 04 : 33 : 43 AM ) Alondra : We do have a brief window after your weekly deadline where we can usually stop an order from going out , but I ’ m afraid that we &apos;re beyond that period of time . I wish there was more I could do !

( 04 : 34 : 16 AM ) Jacki Trinh : what &apos;s the time window

( 04 : 34 : 54 AM ) Alondra : Your weekly deadline is every Monday before 2PM PT . However , our weekly deadline to make any changes or cancel an order for you on our end is Tuesday &apos;s before 5PM PT .

( 04 : 35 : 17 AM ) Jacki Trinh : sorry what &apos;s the delivery time wincow

( 04 : 35 : 27 AM ) Alondra : Oh my apologies !

( 04 : 36 : 38 AM ) Alondra : The delivery window the carriers do give us is between 8am-9pm , as it depends on the drivers route for the day . However , with the holidays and the higher volume of deliveries the carriers have experienced this holiday season , the delivery window they have given us is between 8am-midnight .

( 04 : 37 : 36 AM ) Alondra : We package our meals to withstand 2 full days of transit time and up to 12 hours upon delivery by using non-toxic gel ice packs along with aluminum lining and denim insulation , to keep the meals fresh and cool to the touch .

( 04 : 37 : 54 AM ) Jacki Trinh : what if am not here

( 04 : 38 : 24 AM ) Alondra : You do not need to be home to receive the delivery , as no signature is required and the driver will leave the package at your doorstep .

( 04 : 38 : 38 AM ) Jacki Trinh : there &apos;s a gate without code

( 04 : 39 : 29 AM ) Alondra : So are you saying that the driver needs a gate code to have access into the apartment building property to be able to leave the package at your doorstep ?

( 04 : 40 : 04 AM ) Alondra : If so , then they will just go ahead and leave it in the leasing office .

( 04 : 40 : 06 AM ) Jacki Trinh : there &apos;s no code someone will need to open gate or come out if they call

( 04 : 40 : 26 AM ) Jacki Trinh : where is the leasing office

( 04 : 41 : 14 AM ) Alondra : I do apologize for the confusion ! Does your apartment building not have a leasing office or like a main lobby or mail room ?

( 04 : 41 : 25 AM ) Jacki Trinh : nope

( 04 : 41 : 36 AM ) Jacki Trinh : we just have a key to gate

( 04 : 41 : 57 AM ) Alondra : Okay , then how were you able to receive your Sunday , December 23rd order last week ?

( 04 : 42 : 04 AM ) Jacki Trinh : I was home

( 04 : 42 : 19 AM ) Alondra : Okay and did the driver buzz in or called you ?

( 04 : 42 : 46 AM ) Alondra : I am just trying to get a better understanding of this situation .

( 04 : 43 : 14 AM ) Jacki Trinh : I called axelhire and told them to give the driver my number so he can call for me to come out . I also left a noted outside gate for him to call me

( 04 : 44 : 20 AM ) Jacki Trinh : am calling axelhire now

( 04 : 44 : 22 AM ) Alondra : Okay , so without the driver calling you , there is no way that they would be able to leave the package ?

( 04 : 45 : 15 AM ) Jacki Trinh : no

( 04 : 45 : 39 AM ) Jacki Trinh : there &apos;s just a street sidewalk .

( 04 : 46 : 17 AM ) Alondra : I do apologize about that ! However , if there is any delivery issues with your package or if you do not receive your package tomorrow . Please do reach back out to us and we will go ahead and investigate and accommodate you in regards to this matter .
